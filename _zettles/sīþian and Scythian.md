# sīþian and Scythian
Struck by the phonetic similarity between sīþian and Scythian. Granted, sīþian has a long vowel in the first syllable while Scythian‘s first vowel is short. Regardless, it seemed too fitting that sīþian is an Old English verb to describe journey, expedition, and adventure, and the Scythian people, being a nomadic warrior tribe, would have had their fair share of journeys, expeditions, and adventures.

I used bing chat to flesh out some theories:

There is no clear etymological relation between the Old English word sīþian and the Ancient Greek name Scythian. They are both derived from different sources and have different meanings. However, there are some possible connections that can be explored.

- One possibility is that sīþian and Scythian are both related to the Proto-Indo-European root *skei-, which means to cut, split, or divide. This root is also the source of words like science, schism, and scissors. According to this theory, sīþian means to cut or divide one's way through a journey, and Scythian means to cut or divide one's enemies with arrows. ¹
- Another possibility is that sīþian and Scythian are both related to the Proto-Indo-European root *seikw-, which means to follow or pursue. This root is also the source of words like seek, sequel, and sequence. According to this theory, sīþian means to follow or pursue a journey, and Scythian means to follow or pursue one's enemies with arrows. ²
- A third possibility is that sīþian and Scythian are both related to the Proto-Indo-European root *sweik-, which means to bend or turn. This root is also the source of words like swerve, switch, and sickle. According to this theory, sīþian means to bend or turn one's way through a journey, and Scythian means to bend or turn one's arrows with skill. ³

These are only speculative theories, and there is no definitive evidence to support them. It is more likely that sīþian and Scythian are coincidental similarities that have no common origin or meaning.
