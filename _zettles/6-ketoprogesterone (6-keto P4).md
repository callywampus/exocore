# 6-ketoprogesterone (6-keto P4)
6-ketoprogesterone (6-keto P4) is an orally active oxidized form of progesterone that contains a keto group at position C6. According to studies, it has pronounced anticatabolic (hypertrophic) effects on muscle tissue equal to 2/3 of the effects of testosterone. In addition, the studies claim that 6-keto P4 has no estrogenic, antigonadotropic, thermogenic, or other effects commonly associated with progesterone, while having only about 1/6 of the sedative effects of progesterone. As such, 6-keto P4 effects appear to be focused almost entirely on opposition to cortisol - i.e. antagonism to GR and subsequent downstream effects associated with glucocorticoids.

tldr progesterone minus side effects (thermogenisis, lethargy, estrogen etc).

Optimal dose: The animal study would extrapolate to a HED of 0.1mg/kg, which means 6mg-10mg daily for most people. My method is more cautious, started with 1mg and added 1mg per day until best effects. Too little cortisol can cause joint ache.

Some caution from Ray:

Email subject: 6-ketoprogesterone  
Q: "Hi ray, i was wondering if i could get your thoughts on this compound. Haidut has quoted you as saying that it's structural features could impart properties on it of the main beneficial steroids you've written about, and he quoted you describing sleep and dream quality as a way of ascertaining the utility of novel compounds. I personally dont like how he uses your name to sell his products, but some say im over reacting, and im wondering if you had any feelings on that as well, haidut quoting you, explicitly or implicitly, to sell his products."  
  
Ray: "If something has been seriously investigated for several decades, with a perfect safety record, I might cautiously experiment with it myself, but that’s something I have rarely done. I hear that people are selling things as if I had recommended them, often things that I have warned could be risky. Here are other email comments I’ve made about that particular substance:  
**_= Where have you heard about it? I’ve seen it advertised for body builders, but I don’t know of actual research with it. Large doses seem very likely to interfere with progesterone functions, which might cause brain problems._  
  
_= It’s that progesterone has extensive functions that are essential for survival in good health, and something which closely resembles its structure is likely to interfere in those processes. It could take years for irreversible and disastrous effects to be noticed._  
  
_= I think there’s far too little information to judge the risks confidently; I would want at least some good long term animal studies before I tried one of them."_**
