# 6-ketoprogesterone (6-keto P4)
6-ketoprogesterone (6-keto P4) is an orally active oxidized form of progesterone that contains a keto group at position C6. According to studies, it has pronounced anticatabolic (hypertrophic) effects on muscle tissue equal to 2/3 of the effects of testosterone. In addition, the studies claim that 6-keto P4 has no estrogenic, antigonadotropic, thermogenic, or other effects commonly associated with progesterone, while having only about 1/6 of the sedative effects of progesterone. As such, 6-keto P4 effects appear to be focused almost entirely on opposition to cortisol - i.e. antagonism to GR and subsequent downstream effects associated with glucocorticoids. ^1

**tldr progesterone minus side effects** (thermogenisis, lethargy, estrogen etc).

Optimal dose: The animal study would extrapolate to a HED of 0.1mg/kg, which means 6mg-10mg daily for most people. Apply SFA version topically or the tocopherol one orally or on the gums. Suggested cycle every 2-3 months. My method is more cautious, starting with 1mg and adding 1mg per day until subjective best effects. 

Further info on 6-keto steroids:
*"If one looks at the structure of these steroids we can deduce their benefits. It appears that all 6-Keto anabolics work by increasing both protein synthesis (suggested via messenger RNA) and myotubule increases (the creation of new muscle cells) and the only thing that separates them is their ability to be metabolically cleared in the body.*

*In order of excretion (rendering the steroids inactive) would come at the expense of their hydroxyl groups and skeleton modifications. Hydroxyl groups are ripe pickings for sulfotransferase, which makes sulfated forms of these steroids. Sulfated steroids are what is commonly excreted in the urine as the body processes steroids, so the more resistant the steroid to sulfation the greater the activity...*

*6-Keto-Progesterone – this steroid is the most metabolically active since it has no hydroxyl groups at the C17 side chain and also has a 3-keto group, which must be converted to a hydroxy before it can be sulfated."*^2

6-keto P4 seems solid, but not a total silver bullet. Some caution from Ray:

_Email subject: 6-ketoprogesterone  
Q: "Hi ray, i was wondering if i could get your thoughts on this compound. Haidut has quoted you as saying that it's structural features could impart properties on it of the main beneficial steroids you've written about, and he quoted you describing sleep and dream quality as a way of ascertaining the utility of novel compounds. I personally dont like how he uses your name to sell his products, but some say im over reacting, and im wondering if you had any feelings on that as well, haidut quoting you, explicitly or implicitly, to sell his products."  
  
*Ray: "If something has been seriously investigated for several decades, with a perfect safety record, I might cautiously experiment with it myself, but that’s something I have rarely done. I hear that people are selling things as if I had recommended them, often things that I have warned could be risky. Here are other email comments I’ve made about that particular substance:
= Where have you heard about it? I’ve seen it advertised for body builders, but I don’t know of actual research with it. Large doses seem very likely to interfere with progesterone functions, which might cause brain problems.
  
*= It’s that progesterone has extensive functions that are essential for survival in good health, and something which closely resembles its structure is likely to interfere in those processes. It could take years for irreversible and disastrous effects to be noticed.*
  
*= I think there’s far too little information to judge the risks confidently; I would want at least some good long term animal studies before I tried one of them."*

The phrasing being inconsistent with the way Ray writes has lead to some skepticism as to whether this is a legitimate email from Ray or a faked quote to bash haidut. For the sake of providing multiple perspectives I am including it.

Since this chemical likely opposes cortisol, in a stressful situation if the body cannot mount a cortisol response it may compensate with adrenaline. Some are stacking 6-keto P4 with Pansterone in approximately a 2:1 ratio to account for this. 6-keto, being a progestogen, may compete with progesterone and T for access to the 5-AR enzyme and when used on its own to result in lower DHT or allopregnanolone levels, another reason to stack. I have personally not observed a need for this but it is worth mentioning.

Anecdotal reports suggest high doses of 6-keto P4 can cause joint ache from lowering cortisol too much.
