# 6-ketoprogesterone (6-keto P4)
6-ketoprogesterone (6-keto P4) is an orally active oxidized form of progesterone that contains a keto group at position C6. According to studies, it has pronounced anticatabolic (hypertrophic) effects on muscle tissue equal to 2/3 of the effects of testosterone. In addition, the studies claim that 6-keto P4 has no estrogenic, antigonadotropic, thermogenic, or other effects commonly associated with progesterone, while having only about 1/6 of the sedative effects of progesterone. As such, 6-keto P4 effects appear to be focused almost entirely on opposition to cortisol - i.e. antagonism to GR and subsequent downstream effects associated with glucocorticoids.

tldr progesterone minus side effects (thermogenisis, lethargy, estrogen etc).

Optimal dose: The animal study would extrapolate to a HED of 0.1mg/kg, which means 6mg-10mg daily for most people. My method is more cautious, started with 1mg and added 1mg per day until best effects. Too little cortisol can cause joint ache.
