Famotadine is an H2 antagonist. Probably my personal favorite of the three because it's able to increase glycogen storage and suppresses gluconeogenesis. Famotadine is hepatoprotective and scavenges nitric oxide. There's not a lot of substances that directly suppress gluconeogenesis. Biotin, aspirin, and famotadine is about it. Famotadine of course is also anti-serotonin, perhaps powerfully so. Intravenous famotadine has been shown to stop serotonin syndrome. Downsides, it will lower stomach acid. If you're already severely hypothyroid, then your stomach acid is probably too low to benefit from famotadine. There is also some trouble with sourcing a clean product. Most of the pepcid pills on the market is full of bad ingredients. Your best bet is to just order it pure from a place like sigma-aldrich, and dissolve it in DMSO to take topically. An acceptable compromise would be dissolving the pills in hot water and adding a dash of ACV, because the acetic acid in the vinegar increases the solubility. Mix thoroughly, and wait for all the sediment to settle. That's the excipients that can be thrown out.
