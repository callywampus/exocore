# High HDL
High HDL is usually due to high endotoxin or other toxic load. A few nights of heavy drinking can also elevate HDL above normal range due to the endotoxin effects of alcohol. A bout of the "flu" can also do it. High-fat food (fried, fat food, etc) can also do it but it is more rare.

directly conflicts with peat quote in SIBO

did they mean high LDL? in relation to HDL? cannot for the life of me remember the source of this post but it doesnt seem right

might be both
