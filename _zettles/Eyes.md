Usually your eyes are dry because your tears are evaporating too fast, not because you need more tears

Eyelids have bunch of glands in them that secrete meibomian, an oily substance that forms a film over the surface of your eye and prevents tears from evaporating

Imagine if you had 2 cups of water and you poured a layer of cooking oil on top of one before leaving them out. The cup without oil would evaporate way before the other one because oil traps the water inside and prevents evaporation

Eyes are the same way. If you mess with meibomian production by eating a weird diet composed of 5000 pills or clogging the glands, you'll get dry eyes.
