# Estrogen - cortisol pathway
An excess of estrogen (or any stressor) causes the pituitary to secrete prolactin and ACTH, and both of these hormones act on the ovaries to stop progesterone production, and contribute in many other ways to the process of atrophy. ACTH, of course, stimulates the secretion of cortisol.
