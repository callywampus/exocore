one of two stable isotopes of hydrogen

apparently in high concentrations in raw milk

Deuterium affects the H bonds between DNA strands, in molecules like NAD, sex steroid hormones are packed with protium hydrogens. Testosterone has 28. If some are swapped with deuterium, it affects the resonance of the hormone. An endless list of effects from excess deuterium. (https://twitter.com/k2calibre/status/1662216115991502848)
