# NAD+ to NADH Ratio
A healthy cell has 400 NAD+ for every 1 NADH

while supping NAD+ could be beneficial, its far more bang for your buck to remove NADH

means supping pyruvate (which would facilitate the conversion of NADH back to NAD+) would be beneficial i guess?

but direct niacinamide supplementation might be better
