# The DHA Question™

## Anti:

DHA, as an unsaturated(n-3) fatty acid, undergoes lipid peroxidation upon metabolization. These products of lipid peroxidation, HNE, MDA, acrolein, glyoxal, and other highly reactive aldehydes, damage the mitochondria, reducing the ability to oxidize sugar, and to produce energy and protective carbon dioxide. Reducing CO2 is subotimal because CO2 promotes mitochondrial neogenesis(creation of new mitochondria). 

if light and heat degrade dha why cook it? what happens to a pi electron cloud under sun exposure?  

DHA and arachidonic acid increase the excitatory effect of glutamate on its receptor (Yeh, et aI., 1995), and decrease the uptake of glutamate by the protein that binds it to stop the excitatory process (Yu, et aI., 1986). These fats cause swelling of mitochondria and cells, and increase vascular permeability. Saturated fats don't have those excitatory effects. [[the-gaba-system-defenses-and-tissue-renewal.pdf]]

## Pro:

DHA specifically is special, and different than other n-3 fatty acids. because it has 22 carbons in it and those 22 carbons are all double-bonded. It means they have a π electron cloud, and fx to store more electrons. These electrons, upon exposure to sunlight, become excited and activate the photoelectric effect, creating a DC current that energizes and protects the brain. That's why DHA is very important for the brain. Brain lacking DHA = less electrons. Less electrons = mitochondria swell to increase capacity. Less fx mitochondria = cell die. 

DHA has made it through 600 million years of evolution, indicating its importance https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/179/suppl_11/61/4210234?login=false

*Both studies were gold-standard randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and both compared the impact of a highly oxidized fish oil, a regular fish oil, and a placebo on a wide variety of established markers of oxidation and antioxidative systems....demonstrated that high dosages of highly oxidized fish oil do not induce oxidative stress in our bodies.* https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lite.201600013

specifically, DHA from seafood. is in useable SN-2 position and selenium + iodine in seafood prevent oxidation (fact check)

One theory DHA-derived lipid peroxides causing oxidative damage to mylenin + EMF-induced demylenation of nerve cells. This process gets out of control becaude the omega-6 controlled arachidonic acid that would usually suppress this stress is itself suppressed by excess DHA

With the overconsumption of EPA and DHA, serum polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration can far outstrip the body’s natural defenses against lipid peroxidation. I am not talking about fish oils that have oxidized due to heat exposure or improper storage. This is something that happens in blood serum and in the brain when fat soluble antioxidants stores have been overutilized. This can easily happen with low-grade, chronic infection, exposure to electromagnetic fields, stress and trauma, and any other trigger for oxidative stress systemically. The result is an increase in DHA-derived lipid peroxides and, eventually, oxidative damage to myelin. The double-insult here is that in addition to lipid peroxidation and demyelination (potentially induced by EMF-exposure), the high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids have suppressed the arachidonic acid cascade, and damage to neurons cannot be sufficiently repaired nor grown with the help of neurotrophin-derived factors.

But the problem does not stop there. Cannabinoids, produced endogenously from arachidonic acid, play major neuromodulatory roles in the central nervous system by their inhibition (via cannabinoid receptor CB1R) of voltage-gated calcium channels.13

These cannabinoids have also been shown to modulate these channels directly by pulling back the reigns on not only high blood pressure, through lowered aldosterone, but also by mitigating excitotoxicity from intracellular calcium. When there is insufficient arachidonic acid from overconsumption of seafood high in DHA/EPA, the endocannabinoid system is no longer able to prevent calcium influx into cells — in particular, myelin. This causes the subsequent activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and calpain, which degrade myelin lipids and proteins.14

In addition to the affects described above, an excessive DHA to AA ratio is also capable of inducing apoptosis through multiple mechanisms, including translocation of phosphatidylserine15, elevated BAX and CASP3 activity16 resulting from disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential17, and activation of PPARs via the p38 signaling pathway.18 With limited neuronal growth / repair and endocannabinoid deficits, calcium-induced oxidative stress can perpetuate neuroinflammation leading to further non-enzymatic oxidation of DHA. This produces extremely reactive neuroketals and additional toxic metabolites19, creating a potential demyelinating cascade. With increased demyelination and intracellular calcium, electromagnetic fields are capable of producing acute responses in the central and peripheral nervous systems characterized by the standard EHS symptomotology.
