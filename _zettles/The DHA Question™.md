# The DHA Question™

## Peat View:

DHA, as an unsaturated(n-3) fatty acid, undergoes lipid peroxidation upon metabolization. These products of lipid peroxidation, HNE, MDA, acrolein, glyoxal, and other highly reactive aldehydes, damage the mitochondria, reducing the ability to oxidize sugar, and to produce energy and protective carbon dioxide. Reducing CO2 is subotimal because CO2 promotes mitochondrial neogenesis(creation of new mitochondria). 

## Kruse view:

DHA specifically is special, and different than other n-3 fatty acids. because it has 22 carbons in it and those 22 carbons are all double-bonded. It means they have a π electron cloud, and fx to store more electrons. These electrons, upon exposure to sunlight, become excited and activate the photoelectric effect, creating a DC current that energizes and protects the brain. That's why DHA is very important for the brain. Brain lacking DHA = less electrons. Less electrons = mitochondria swell to increase capacity. Less fx mitochondria = cell die.
