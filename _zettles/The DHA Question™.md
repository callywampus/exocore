# The DHA Question™

## Anti:

DHA, as an unsaturated(n-3) fatty acid, undergoes lipid peroxidation upon metabolization. These products of lipid peroxidation, HNE, MDA, acrolein, glyoxal, and other highly reactive aldehydes, damage the mitochondria, reducing the ability to oxidize sugar, and to produce energy and protective carbon dioxide. Reducing CO2 is subotimal because CO2 promotes mitochondrial neogenesis(creation of new mitochondria). 

if light and heat degrade dha why cook it? what happens to a pi electron cloud under sun exposure?  

One theory DHA-derived lipid peroxides causing oxidative damage to mylenin + EMF-induced demylenation of nerve cells. This process gets out of control becaude the omega-6 controlled arachidonic acid that would usually suppress this stress is itself suppressed by excess DHA

## Pro:

DHA specifically is special, and different than other n-3 fatty acids. because it has 22 carbons in it and those 22 carbons are all double-bonded. It means they have a π electron cloud, and fx to store more electrons. These electrons, upon exposure to sunlight, become excited and activate the photoelectric effect, creating a DC current that energizes and protects the brain. That's why DHA is very important for the brain. Brain lacking DHA = less electrons. Less electrons = mitochondria swell to increase capacity. Less fx mitochondria = cell die. 

DHA has made it through 600 million years of evolution, indicating its importance https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/179/suppl_11/61/4210234?login=false

*Both studies were gold-standard randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and both compared the impact of a highly oxidized fish oil, a regular fish oil, and a placebo on a wide variety of established markers of oxidation and antioxidative systems....demonstrated that high dosages of highly oxidized fish oil do not induce oxidative stress in our bodies.* https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lite.201600013

specifically, DHA from seafood. is in useable SN-2 position and selenium + iodine in seafood prevent oxidation (fact check)
