# Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs)

Nomenclature of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300810570

Electromagnetic fields act _via_ activation of voltage-gated calcium channels to produce beneficial or adverse effects https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.12088

the amount required to cause cell degranulation of Human polymorphonuclear leucocytes is a static magnetic field of 0.1T, or 1,000,000mG, whereas the average household has a noncontinuous magnetic field of 2000-5000mG. I suppose the theory is the noncontinuous and ever-present nature of the fields could cause similar calcium signaling issues over time, despite being magnitudes of order less powerful.
