*"EMF can induce changes in calcium signaling cascades, significant activation of free radical processes and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells as well as altered neurological and cognitive functions and disruption of the blood-brain barrier....

*It is concluded that the mechanisms underlying the symptoms of EHS are biologically plausible and that many organic physiologic responses occur following EMF exposure."* Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS, microwave syndrome) - Review of mechanisms https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32289567/

EMFs - both the electronic and magnetic - are terrible. There is literally CONCLUSIVE evidence on this stuff. Please read the studies in the bibliography. I'll post a select few, some from Robert Becker, and some from others:

Exposure to electromagnetic fields and suicide among electric utility workers: a nested case-control study

The effect of geomagnetic storms on suicide  
Conclusions:Geomagnetic storm activity is correlated with suicide, and confirms previous research suggesting an impact of ambient magnetic field activity on behaviour

Laboratory studies have shown that electromagnetic fields similar to those from high-voltage transmission lines can produce biological effects. Surveys of the actual effects of such lines on exposed individuals usually have been hampered by complicating factors tending to blur the data. By means of a new approach, however, correlation has been established between the presence of transmission-line fields and the occurrence of suicides in part of the Midlands of England.

In vivo bioelectrochemical changes associated with exposure to extremely low frequency electric fields.

One hundred seventy-four 21- to 24-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously exposed to a 60 Hz electric field of 150 V/cm for one month in ten separate experiments. Biological effects observed included depressed body weights, serum corticoids, and water consumption. The findings are tentatively in terpreted as indicating that a power frequency electric field is a biological stressor. The observed effects cannot be a consequence of Joule heating and therefore indicate that electric fields can influence biological systems either at the systemic level, or at the cellular level via electrochemical alteration of the microenvironment.*


try and determine if the stetzer filters even work or if they're just dirtying up the neutral ,/ ground by sending the dirty electricity down those paths and not really eliminate in it? As far as stetzer and greenwave filters are concerned, you can use acheap Chinese "save energy boxes" instead, which are the same thing internally as a stetzer filter (fairly large capacitor and a resistor - to dissipate the built-up charge when unplugged) - you may need a couple more but they're so cheap it doesn't matter, they're like $3 a piece on eBay and Ali Express.
