# molybdenum depletion due to glyphosate exposure cause issues w sulfur metabolism
Here are some relevant studies and articles that I found about whether molybdenum depletion due to glyphosate exposure can cause issues with sulfur metabolism:

- A review article that discusses the role of molybdenum in human health and the potential adverse effects of glyphosate on molybdenum-dependent enzymes, such as sulfite oxidase, which is responsible for converting sulfite to sulfate. [The article also suggests that molybdenum deficiency may contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease, autism, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease](https://mthfrgenesupport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/H2S-oxalates-and-sulfur.pdf)[1](https://mthfrgenesupport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/H2S-oxalates-and-sulfur.pdf).
- A research article that investigates the effects of glyphosate on the activity and expression of sulfite oxidase in rat liver and kidney. The article reports that glyphosate significantly reduced the activity and expression of sulfite oxidase in both organs, as well as the levels of molybdenum and sulfate in the serum. [The article also shows that glyphosate induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver and kidney](https://mthfrgenesupport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/H2S-oxalates-and-sulfur.pdf)[2](https://www.imoa.info/HSE/environmental_data/biology/sulfur_metabolism.php).
- A research article that examines the effects of glyphosate on the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids in rats. The article demonstrates that glyphosate decreased the levels of cysteine, methionine, taurine, and glutathione in the liver and plasma, and increased the levels of homocysteine and cystathionine in the plasma. [The article also reveals that glyphosate impaired the transsulfuration pathway and the synthesis of sulfate from cysteine](https://ndnr.com/gastrointestinal/sibo-as-an-adaptation-a-proposed-role-for-hydrogen-sulfide/)[3](https://ndnr.com/gastrointestinal/sibo-as-an-adaptation-a-proposed-role-for-hydrogen-sulfide/).
- A research article that explores the effects of glyphosate on the sulfur metabolism of wheat plants. The article indicates that glyphosate reduced the uptake and assimilation of sulfate, as well as the synthesis of cysteine and glutathione in the leaves and roots. [The article also suggests that glyphosate disturbed the redox balance and the antioxidant defense system of the plants](https://mthfrgenesupport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/H2S-oxalates-and-sulfur.pdf)[4](https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/low-sulfur-diet-benefits/).

I hope these studies and articles help you understand the possible impact of glyphosate on molybdenum and sulfur metabolism. If you want to read more, you can use the links provided in the references.
