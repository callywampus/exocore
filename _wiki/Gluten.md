# Gluten
Reading [Dr. Jean Seignalet](https://www.seignalet.fr/en/) who points out that gluten constituents, the peptides called gliadins, resist the action of our digestive enzymes.

The resistance of gliadins to digestive enzymes is due to their very rigid cyclic structure consisting of several repititions of two amino acids, proline and glutamine. Four types of gliadins (named alpha, beta, gamma and omega) were identified, and gliadin-alpha has more pronounced pathogenic effects than other gliadins. In fact, gliadin-alpha has a superior ability to activate the immune system in an exacerbated manner, as well as other pathogenic characteristics that can alter the normal behavior of cells.

Curiously, he posits that the animal milk protein casein has a structure similar to that of gliadin-alpha, and that there is an immunological relationship with gliadin-alpha since the antibodies developed against this peptide also react with caseins of animal milk.

forum discussing his ideas [here](https://mirzoune-ciboulette.forumactif.org/t767-lagace-une-alimentation-ciblee-pour-preserver-ou-retrouver-la-sante-de-lintestin-leffet-antidouleur-dune-diete-hypotoxique#7152) 

I wonder if A2 casein is structurally dissimilar enough to explain why many find A2 milk less inflammatory and more digestible
