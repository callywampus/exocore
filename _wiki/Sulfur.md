# Sulfur
## Random sulfur notes 

The total sulfur content in milk can range from 3,450 to 4,370 parts per million (ppm). The total sulfur content in casein can range from 7,060 to 8,020 ppm, and in whey protein, it can range from 10,520 to 10,800 ppm.<sup>1</sup>

Unheated raw milk contains low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, organic sulfides, and carbonyl-35S compounds. The type and concentration of free volatile sulfur compounds can vary depending on the type of sulfur compound used or the individual cow.<sup>2</sup>

Thermal processing and storage of milk can cause the formation of volatile sulfur compounds, which can lead to undesirable sulfurous off-flavors. These compounds include: 

Hydrogen sulfide, Methanethiol, Carbonyl sulfide, Dimethyl sulfide, Carbon disulphide, Dimethyl disulphide, Dimethyl trisulphide, Dimethyl sulphoxide, Dimethyl sulphone.<sup>3, 4, 5</sup>
