# Histamine
The [[Amino Acids]] precursor of histamine is histidine. Many species of bacteria and yeast contain the enzyme histidine decarboxylase (HDC), which turns histidine into histamine. So, when meat (or fish) is not immediately consumed or frozen, bacteria get straight to work breaking down the amino acids within it, and one of the by-products is histamine. Products like milk will contain histidine, and bacteria like [[Lactobacillus]] can convert that histidine into histamine in the GI tract.

Hans Selye, the "father of stress research" mentions in his 1936 Nature paper, first describing the stress response histamine toxicosis.

Histamine is released when mast cells degranulate, as seen in [[[Stress + EMF = Allergy]].

## Antihistamines
The first-developed antihistamines were so toxic they had to be abandoned. But the principle behind their design endured and we got Ciproheptadine.

[[Cyproheptadine]] is H1 histamine receptor blocker + also a serotonin antagonist, apparently histamine and serotonin receptors overlap

Benadryl similar to cypro but raises serotonin in the brain? maybe avoid

[[Famotidine]] is H2 receptor blocker

Ketotifen 
- Pros: TNF-Alpha lowering, anti-serotonin, mast cell stabilization, helps w// IBS likely bc [[TLR-4]] antagonist
- Cons: powerfully promotes NO synthesis
