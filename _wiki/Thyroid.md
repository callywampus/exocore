Thyroid hormone issues can occur within cells throughout your body rather than your thyroid.

This is because the majority of your T3 is converted from T4 within the cell, not the thyroid gland. 

What causes this poor conversion?

LPS from gram negative bacteria in your gut can inhibit the enzyme DIO2 that converts T4 to T3. 

Inflammation or stress/cell danger response can stiffen cell membranes which also inhibits the conversion and may cause the body to convert T4 to reverse T3. 

T3 is required for neurons and neurotransmitters, liver function, ATP, bone turnover, and mitochondrial function. And much more. 

Thyroid hormone issues do not always mean you have an issue with your thyroid gland.

Estrogen inhibits conversion of T4 to T3, hence why women have issues with the T4-only supplementation common in the united states. Under the influence of stress hormones like estrogen, T4 converts into reverse T3 (rT3) which suppresses metabolic function

About half of women have trouble making the T4 -> T3 conversion, and women have 10x the amount of thyroid disease

boiling milk, seaweed and oysters together is a good homemade substitute for thyroid supplementation
