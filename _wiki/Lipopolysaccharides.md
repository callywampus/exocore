# Lipopolysaccharides 
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is **the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria**. Lipopolysaccharide is localized in the outer layer of the membrane and is, in noncapsulated strains, exposed on the cell surface. The cell envelope is the first line of defense between a bacterium and the world-at-large. When gram-negative bacteria die, such as when colonies get fed and experience turnover, 

Endotoxins, often referred to by their active component, lipopolysaccharides are formed in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria and can trigger a profound inflammatory response mediated by cytokine release. In a recent study of healthy human volunteers administered _E. coli_ endotoxin intravenously, elevations in cytokines, particularly TNF_α_, were noted compared to baseline and the authors noted that several of the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome were observed after endotoxin administration, including elevations core temperature, heart rate, and white blood cell (WBC) count, and noted elevations of epinephrine and cortisol [43].

Endotoxins can also interact synergistically with other toxins worsening the consequences of exposure. In one study, LPS was injected intracerebrally into a neonatal rat to trigger brain inflammation and it was found that the application of the pesticide rotenone resulted in motor and neurobehavioral impairments in the rats exposed to LPS and not in the unexposed rats [50]

LPS are amphipathic molecules, meaning they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. LPS are composed of a lipid A moiety, which anchors them to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and a polysaccharide chain, which extends outward from the cell surface. [The lipid A portion is hydrophobic and interacts with the phospholipids of the membrane, while the polysaccharide portion is hydrophilic and interacts with water and other molecules in the environment](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-015-0581-7)
