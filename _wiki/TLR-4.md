# TLR-4

There are different types of molecules that can block the TLR4 receptor, which is a protein that recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and triggers an inflammatory response. Some of these molecules are:

- **TLR4 antagonists**: These are molecules that bind to the extracellular domain of TLR4 and prevent the interaction of LPS with the receptor. [For example, LPS-RS is a synthetic LPS analog that acts as a TLR4 antagonist](https://www.invivogen.com/tlr-inhibitors)[1](https://www.invivogen.com/tlr-inhibitors).
- **Anti-TLR4 antibodies**: These are antibodies that bind to the surface of TLR4 and block its activation by LPS or other ligands. [For example, anti-hTLR4 is an antibody against human TLR4](https://www.invivogen.com/tlr-inhibitors)[1](https://www.invivogen.com/tlr-inhibitors).
- **Decoy peptides**: These are peptides that mimic the intracellular domain of TLR4 and compete with the receptor for binding to the adaptor molecules that mediate the downstream signaling. [For example, Pepinh-TRIF is a peptide that inhibits the TRIF-dependent pathway of TLR4](https://www.invivogen.com/tlr-inhibitors)[1](https://www.invivogen.com/tlr-inhibitors).
- **Small molecule inhibitors**: These are compounds that target the intracellular domain of TLR4 or the enzymes that are involved in the signaling cascade. [For example, TAK-242 is a small molecule inhibitor that binds to a cysteine residue in the intracellular domain of TLR4 and disrupts the interaction with the adaptor molecules](https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-020-2097-2)[2](https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13075-020-2097-2)[3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02434/full).

- TLR4 is also involved in sensing endogenous molecules that are released during tissue damage or stress, such as heat shock proteins
