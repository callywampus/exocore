Vit C reduces iron, and then that iron can give its electron directly to water, creating the hydroxyl free radical, the most dangerous of the free radicals

\>250mg converts to oxlate?interaction w iron forms oxalic acid

also too much interferes w/ ceruloplasmin creating unbound copper

there are only 3 producers in the world?

10mg ascorbic acid alone was enough to cure scurvy

maybe the extra parts of the "complex" are beneficial but apparently not necessary for survival
