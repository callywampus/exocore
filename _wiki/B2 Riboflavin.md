# B2 Riboflavin
[Riboflavin Inhibits Histamine-Dependent Itch by Modulating Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.643483/full)

>Riboflavin, vitamin B2, is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, and it is very easily destroyed by light (blue light and especially ultraviolet). When it is excited by high energy light, it can spread the damage to other components of the mitochondria, including the cytochromes and the polyunsaturated fatty acids. The other B vitamins are affected when riboflavin's actions are disturbed.

>He showed that one of the injuries that could produce aerobic glycolysis was a deficiency of riboflavin.

>Riboflavin can probably be useful when applied topically, but because of its extreme sensitivity to light, it should usually be used only internally, unless the treated skin is covered to prevent exposure to light.

>The body absorbs little riboflavin from single doses beyond 27 mg and stores only small amounts of riboflavin in the liver, heart, and kidneys. When excess amounts are consumed, they are either not absorbed or the small amount that is absorbed is excreted in urine [[3](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-HealthProfessional/#en3)].

3oz pan fried beef liver contains 2.9mg riboflavin, the highest content in any food.
Increasing intake beyond that will require supplementation.

>Riboflavin deficiency has often been associated with oral lesions, like cheilosis, angular stomatitis, and glossitis. Patients with these lesions sometimes fail to respond to riboflavin treatment alone and require supplementation with vitamin B6 or other B-complex vitamins.
