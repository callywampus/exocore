## BILE IS REQUIRED FOR VITAMIN A ABSORPTION

Throughout this blog I’ve discussed a bunch of somewhat complex topics. You’ve already heard about VDR, but FXR and PXR are something you’ve just become aware of. Well, it’s time to learn about another “XR”…RXR.  
  
RXR refers to the retinoid x receptor. The retinoid x receptor does so many things that we’ll only focus on one thing here. RXR makes the other “XRs” work better.  
  
To work, VDR, PXR, and FXR bind to RXR to form something called a heterodimer. A heterodimer gets formed when two large molecules bind together. When RXR binds to any of the above, it forms a super receptor.  
  
When a ligand binds to PXR, it causes genetic expression of that receptors target genes. For example, when LCA binds to PXR, you get a certain level of expression of the genes that process LCA. If PXR forms a heterodimer with RXR and the ligand for RXR is bound to it, you get greater levels of expression of those genes.  
  
It shouldn’t surprise you that the natural ligand for the retinoid x receptors is retinol, a form of vitamin A, specifically, 9-cis retinoic acid. Other receptors that form a heterodimer with RXR include the [[Thyroid]] receptor and liver x receptor.  
  
This means that adequate vitamin A intake optimizes all the processes regulated by these receptors. Conversely, inadequate vitamin A intake can make these processes run poorly.  
  
Now, when we talk about vitamin A, we’re not just talking about any form of vitamin A. Retinol, the form found in animal products, is the form we’re looking for. Pro-vitamin A, which come from plant sources, requires conversion to retinol to activate RXR. In some people, including myself, this conversion is sluggish.  
  
Since vitamin A is fat soluble, bile is required to bring it in to cells. With inadequate bile, you can’t absorb vitamin A from food or supplements. This spells bad news for people who have [[SIBO]].
