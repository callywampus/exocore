# White tongue
White tongue can have a number of root causes which makes it tricky to accurately diagnose and treat. 

"A healthy tongue is pink and covered with papillae, small nodules that are on the surface of the tongue and have a rough texture. When your tongue appears white, that means food debris, bacteria and dead cells have been lodged between inflamed papillae." - [White Tongue Causes & 10 Natural Treatments for White Tongue - Dr. Axe (draxe.com)](https://draxe.com/health/white-tongue/)

### Pharmaceutical Remedies

More intensive treatment includes the antifungal Nystatin.

"For [oral candidiasis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/oral-candidiasis "Learn more about oral candidiasis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), the patient was treated with 5 mL of oral suspension of [nystatin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/nystatin "Learn more about nystatin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") 100,000 UI four times a day for 1 week. After 3 days of [treatment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/therapeutic-procedure "Learn more about treatment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") onset, the oral lesions presented significant improvement. No signs of the [oral plaques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mouth-plaque "Learn more about oral plaques from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") were observed after 1 week. At the same time, the fungiform papillae were normal and the patient no longer complained of pain." - [Uncommon oral manifestations of dengue viral infection - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1808869416302051?via%3Dihub)

"Nystatin is helpful as topical therapy for mild to moderate [mucocutaneous candidiasis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mucocutaneous-candidiasis "Learn more about mucocutaneous candidiasis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Nystatin is available as a suspension (100,000 units/mL) and [pastilles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pastille "Learn more about pastilles from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (200,000 units each). The suspension is administered in a swish-and-swallow format four times a day and can also be used for soaking [dental prostheses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dental-prosthesis "Learn more about dental prostheses from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). The pastilles should be dissolved in the mouth until gone and are taken one or two at a time four to five times per day for 10 to 14 days. Nystatin is nontoxic and usually effective during use, but relapses after therapy are common.25" - [Antimicrobial Pharmacology for Head, Neck, and Orofacial Nonbacterial Infections - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780323289450000090)

"Nystatin is a channel-forming ionophore that creates a hydrophobic pore across a membrane. Channel-forming ionophores allow for the rapid facilitated diffusion of various ions that depend on the dimensions of the pore. Nystatin, like other channel-forming ionophores (eg, amphotericin B and natamycin), is a commonly used antifungal agent. Finding medications that can selectively attack fungi in the presence of normal [animal cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/animal-cell "Learn more about animal cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") presents a difficult challenge since both cell types are eukaryotic. Bacteria, being [prokaryotes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/prokaryote "Learn more about prokaryotes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), are sufficiently different to present a variety of anti-bacterial approaches not amenable to fungi. However, fungi do have an Achilles heel. Fungal plasma membranes have as their dominant sterol [ergosterol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ergosterol "Learn more about ergosterol from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), not the animal sterol cholesterol (see Chapter 5). Nystatin binds preferentially to ergosterol, thus targeting fungi in the presence of animal cells. When present at sufficient levels, nystatin complexes with ergosterol and forms transmembrane channels that lead to K+ leakage and death of the fungus." - [Membrane Transport - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444637727000191)

## Internal Tissues

Sometimes, white tongue that cannot be scraped off and/or doesn’t go away after using local antifungal treatments is the result of deeper gut issues.

"Local bacteria are usually involved in the white tongue, but typically the problem is mainly in the intestine. I have experimented with the old-fashioned "intestinal disinfectant" camphoric acid (it used to be a common pharmaceutical, 80 to 100 years ago), and when I would swallow about 100 to 200 mg of it in the evening, I would wake up with a perfectly clean tongue, not a bit of the white. Bamboo shoots, raw carrot, and flowers of sulfur are other antiseptics that can reduce the white tongue." -Ray Peat e-mail exchange
