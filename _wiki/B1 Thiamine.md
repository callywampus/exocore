# B1 Thiamine
## Dietary Thiamine
Dietary thiamine, existing in naturally occurring food, has to be activated in the body. First, it is absorbed and requires a protein transporter to get it into cells. The transporters are a series of proteins that are under genetic control and in their absence, intracellular thiamine deficiency occurs and may even be present from birth. Their absence seems to be relatively common. Absence of a transporter can be overcome by the use of a thiamine derivative. Thiamine HCL and mononitrate are “salts” and are readily available over-the-counter.  

## Thiamine Derivatives
Many thiamine derivatives exist, but there are two notable ones. One is known as an S acyl derivative (Benfotiamine is one) and another is known as a disulfide (TTFD is one). Both are known as “open ring” forms of thiamine that exists normally as two connected rings known as a thiazolium and a pyrimidine. It is the thiazolium ring that is opened and it is this open ring form that enables it to pass through the cell membrane without the use of a transporter. It is this process that appears to alter the thiamine activity radically, creating something that might be justifiably called a drug. For example, Japanese scientists found that thiamine propyl disulfide, one of the early disulfide synthetics, could protect experimental mice partially from cyanide and/or carbon tetrachloride poisoning. The therapeutic properties of thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (TTFD) are largely untapped and unknown in Western civilization. It has been used for many years in the East where it is a prescription item.
