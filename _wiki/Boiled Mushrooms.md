# Boiled Mushrooms
White button mushrooms boiled for 1-3hrs

an ammonia like compound called Hydrazine. It's toxic to the liver; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/572876](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/572876)  

Ray recommends cooking them for 45 minutes at least to denature the argaritine, and he says the broth should be consumed, as it contains good compounds and nutrition. He briefly mentioned the water will not contain agaratine after a few hours

But agaritine (the carcinogen) is water soluble, when you boil mushrooms most of it will seep out into the cooking water. Some nutritional authorites recommend to discard the water for this reason.

In the study above they measured the argaritine in canned mushrooms and it has already lead to quite the reduction in argaritine, compared to raw mushrooms.   
"The agaritine content in fresh mushrooms was found to be in the range of 94- 629 mg/kg fresh weight. Canned mushrooms contained 1-55 mg/kg drained weight with 3-103 mg/1 in the liquid. The highest agaritine values were found in dried commercial mushrooms amounting to 2,110- 6,905 mg/kg"

The liquid definitely contains agaritine, so this is one of the rare instances of going against Rays recommendation and only eating the mushrooms but not the broth


Could try oyster mushrooms or other kinds as argaritine seems to only occur in mushrooms from the genus AGARICUS

They all have chitin which is the insoluble fibre that cleanses your gut
