	- not all of these reccs are good, definitely do not take 5-HTP lol

The following excerpt is from a now deleted article archived [here](https://raypeatforum.com/community/threads/sibo-treatment-protocol.12310/post-465882) on RPF. It is an excellent initial overview with further notes listed afterwards.

>"I was recently diagnosed with a severe case of methane SIBO (which I’ve had for ~10 years without realizing that it was causing me to bloat constantly) and did a lot of research on what to do about it. By far, the most interesting insights came from about 100 emails plus a 1 hour in-person discussions with Mark Pimentel, who is arguably the world’s #1 expert on SIBO.  
>  
>Because Mark was so generous of his time with me, and because there is so much misinformation on the web about SIBO, I wanted to document the unique insights I learned from him that I didn’t find elsewhere in the hopes that it will help others with this condition.  
>  
>**I’ve reviewed the contents of this summary with Mark for accuracy; he thought it was a great addition to the material he’s put on the web.**  
>  
>This article is concise because it is written for someone who already knows about the SIBO basics, but has more than likely been horribly misinformed along the way in one or more aspects. So this is like an erratum list for the stuff you’ve read so far.  
>  
>Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation out there so this is a 26 minute read. But trust me, you’ll be glad you did! Even if you’ve read a lot about SIBO, you are almost certain to learn some new info that may lead to a much more successful outcome, with fewer side effects, and, in some cases, substantially lower out of pocket costs.  
>  
>To save time, I’ve summarized the most important points at the top.  
>
>1. **SIBO is basically a condition that is, in almost all cases, caused by poor gut motility (failure of the MMC to clean out your small intestine between meals).** You cannot get SIBO unless you have a motility problem. **Therefore, “curing SIBO” is only curing the symptom, not the disease.**
>2. **If you don’t want it to reoccur, you must find out and fix the root cause of the motility problem.** Finding out the root cause means a series of tests which may or may not include physical exam (especially listening to your stomach, upper endoscopy (with biopsies), intestinal MRI and CT scan, [smartPill](https://louisville.edu/medicine/departments/medicine/divisions/gimedicine/physician-resources/lectures/procedures/SP18Ap13Abell.pdf), IB smart blood test, etc). The list of disease states leading to SIBO are listed in Table 1 of Mark’s paper. So if you aren’t following a logical process to find the root cause, it’s going to keep happening and you’ll be stuck on taking a prokinetic each night for a long long time. Finding the root cause is most often a process of hypothesis and eliminating possible causes.
>3. The 2 “golden rules” in order to get rid of SIBO and minimize recurrence are: 1) take a prokinetic pill and 2) eat discrete meals (for example at 8am, 1pm, and 6pm; ideally at least 4 hours between meals, and you do not want to eat right before bedtime).
>4. **You can “kill your way” out of SIBO with antibiotics, but that is only recommended at the very start to get to remission faster. Fix your motility is key. It’s way easier to flush the stuff out with a prokinetic than to kill it.**
>5. In most all cases, until you discover the underlying cause, the only thing you really need is a prokinetic. Mark’s favorite for the prokinetic is prucalopride taken at a low dose (typically .5mg each night before bedtime on an empty stomach, but for some can be less or more). For prucalopride, eat nothing for at least 4 hours before taking the pill at bedtime. Then, after taking the pill, try to fast as long as you can before eating something. The longer you fast, the greater the benefit. But don’t try to be a hero. There is no award for fasting for all 12 hours and nobody is going to test you and see how you are doing. The drug wears off in 12 hours so no point in fasting longer. Personally, i just eat when I wake up and don’t optimize the fasting period. NOTE: Prucalopride is now available in the US (as of April 2019)! [Enzymedica, Gut Motility, Digestive Transport Support](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GDF9XM4?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) is a non-Rx herbal prokinetic that is also effective.
>6. If you cannot tolerate prucalopride, there are other drug options (mentioned in Table 1 in Mark’s paper below): erythromycin and domperidone.
>7. Using only these the two golden rules in #2 above, most people should be able to completely get rid of SIBO and keep it from recurring; one drug and one eating pattern. Total drug cost (if not covered by insurance): typically a little more than $1/day (if you are clever and buy the 2mg pill and split it into 4 pieces like I do).
>8. Most people don’t know the 2 golden rules, so they relapse, sometimes quickly. I hear stories of people taking multiple rounds of antibiotics then herbs in between the antibiotics. This is insane. You really only should have one round of antibiotics tops, and then the pro-kinetic.
>9. **Mark’s [Low-Fermentation Diet (LFD) guide](http://www.siboinfo.com/uploads/5/4/8/4/5484269/low_fermentation_diet.pdf)** [uploaded the file] is highly useful for understanding SIBO and how the digestive system works. It’s a short read, and full of great info and insights you won’t find anywhere else. Mark’s LFD is much easier to adhere to than any of the other SIBO diets (like SCD and FODMAP diets) because it allows a more options so you don’t feel deprived. The whole point of the diet is to identify foods that can be more fully digested and thus minimize bacterial growth. Some foods may not agree with you; avoid them. Some foods may be inappropriate for you, e.g., white bread and rice if you are a diabetic. The foods are simply a list of “relatively safe” foods in general. And you can cheat since the golden rules are the main drivers, not diet. The diet minimizes food for the bacteria if you have not yet addressed the underlying cause of your SIBO. Something is wrong to have caused you to get SIBO in the first place. The LFD is just meant as a stopgap until you discover the root cause of your SIBO. If the root cause is incurable, the the motility is key and the LFD becomes more important. However, **if you can restore normal motility overnight through a prokinetic, the LFD is irrelevant since you are fully cleaned out every night**. I did the LFD for awhile, but I now eat normally. Absolutely no change in symptoms. So be practical: try the LFD diet and if there are no changes in your symptoms, you have Mark’s permission to give it up.
>10. **While you are on the antibiotic regimen, you should ignore the diet. The bacteria are more easily killed when they are replicating so you want to feed them. Mark says, “I have told my patients from day one of rifaximin or treating with antibiotics — and this goes back to the 1980s; this is an old microbiological concept — happy bacteria, happy and well-fed bacteria, are more sensitive to antibiotics and are easier to kill. What that means is that most antibiotics work on the replicating cell wall of bacteria. When bacteria are in hibernation, starving, distressed, they wall off, don’t replicate, and they just sit there, waiting for conditions to improve. That’s a survival mode. So when the bacteria are in survival mode, antibiotics won’t penetrate and won’t work as well.”** see here:  [ Sugar-based Treatment for Persisting Bacterial infection - James Collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDxQT1MRwhk)
>11. While you can get rid of SIBO with ONLY a good prokinetic, you may be able to get rid of SIBO faster by starting with a 2 week antibiotic regimen. For methane dominant SIBO, the recommended treatment is 550 Rifaximin (Xifaxan)+ 250mg Metronidazole (Flagyl) taken 3 times a day for at least 14 days. This is slightly better than the combo with neomycin. Some people get stressed out about not tolerating the drugs. No problem. The antibiotics are optional.
>12. A lot of people may make the mistake of upping the dosage of prucalopride which may lead to undesirable side effects. Also, note that Prucalopride will induce phase III MMCs only when taken in a fasted state. The whole point of prucalopride is give your intestines an extra “boost” during the longest fast of the day (overnight); therefore for SIBO it is prescribed at 25% of the “standard dosage” because the “standard dosing” for prucalopride is set by the labelled use (chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC)), not for SIBO patients. Personally, I found nearly zero difference in how I feel at .5 mg to 2 mg. So stick with the .5 mg unless you have a good reason to go higher. Always take fasted (>4 hours since last meal), right before bed. In my case, if I eat at 7pm, I’ll take the pill at bedtime. Otherwise, if I wake up at night, I’ll take the pill. The pill lasts for 12 hours so ideally you should not eat anything (including pills/medication!!) for 12 hours after taking the pill to get the fastest improvement and the most bang for your buck. If you can’t last 12 hours, don’t sweat it. I’m just citing the ideal. There is no benefit to fasting longer than 12 hours after taking the pill. So far, no side effects whatsoever doing it this way.
>13. I asked Mark if you can simply flush the bacteria out of your small intestine by drinking a lot of water. NB: A lot of water will kill you so don’t do this! He said hydration makes no difference because water is absorbed very quickly so it’s not like you have any chance of “flushing” out the bacteria by supplementing with water. The small bowel when spread out is about [half the size of a badminton court (previously they thought it was the size of a tennis court)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140423111505.htm).
>14. You can monitor your progress during treatment by doing “fasting” breath test. No substrate ingestion is required. Just fast overnight, brush your teeth, and take the breath test. This is not super accurate but is reasonably useful to see if you are making solid progress in the right direction as you consume the drugs. See below on the cheat that you can use to do this very economically. But I basically monitor symptoms. Doing “at home” breath tests is really over the top…suitable for analytical types like me and even I don’t do it.
>15. **You can NEVER win the war against bacteria by trying to starve it.** Bacteria multiply by 2 every 12 hours. So if you could wipe out 99.9% of bacteria with an antibiotic, it will all return in just 5 days. So if you starve the bacteria, the stuff that grows back will be all replicas of the bacteria that is immune to starvation. This is evolution at its finest (especially so if you have methane SIBO; methanogens are very primitive and very hard to kill). This is why all the **clever, innovative approaches people have proposed (Iodine, chlorine, ozone, …) are simply never going to work**. You won’t kill it all and it comes back way too fast. **Your** ONLY **hope of winning is to sweep it out of the small intestine with mechanical action, like a broom sweeping out debris. This is what the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is all about. MMC refers to the “gut clearing” waves that happen every 45–180 minutes between meals. If the gut clearing is weak, you get trash left over in the gut, i.e., SIBO.**
>16. **About half the time, elemental diets do work, but they only work because they partially restore MMC function!** Per Pimentel: “I think the elemental diet is working because it is absorbed in the first 3 feet of small bowel. So the latter 12 feet of small bowel do not see food and bacteria die and dramatically reduce in number. You might say “but in the first 3 feet there is all that good elemental stuff”. That area is tough for bugs because they get bombarded with acid (kills them). They get bombarded with bile (it’s a detergent and kills them) and they get bombarded with enzymes that try to digest them, from the pancreas (which can kill them). Also, If 12/15 feet of small bowel no longer have bacteria (starved out), that’s an 80% reduction in bacterial load.” But there has to be more going on than this. As noted even the previous point, even if you killed 99.9% of the bacteria this way, it will all come back in just 5 days! So what’s going on? Mark wrote, “We did see in a 2003 paper we wrote that **when you get rid of SIBO, MMC are halfway normal**. Not perfect. So still could use prokinetic in order to stay in remission.” In short, when you eradicate the SIBO, your MMC comes back halfway which can keep you from a remission and this remission is even more likely if you take a prokinetic. That’s why the Elemental Diet works for some people… kill + partial restoration of MMC.
>17. **Probiotics and prebiotics: Avoid. Probiotics have mixed results and prebiotics (fiber) is something you want to avoid since it ferments. But like I said, this is fine tuning. I pretty much ignore this myself and there is no symptomatic difference.**
>18. Methane from methanogens can cause constipation. So type of bacteria you have can cause C or D. But since we do not yet have hydrogen sulfide on the breath test, it’s still confusing because this gas can cause diarrhea. In short, you can have a normal-looking breath test and D, and be confused; the cause may be the gas you can’t (yet) measure (but that test is coming in May 2019 from Gemelli Biotech)."

### Biochemistry of relevant gases
[Intestinal Production of Hydrogen Gas (H2) by Bacteria for Reduced Coenzymes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Z9fbqbZKQ)
[Methanogenesis: Intestinal Biosynthesis of Methane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_QGyp69VkM)
[Intestinal Sulfate Reduction to H2S by Sulfur-Reducing Bacteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIOSxde4S3s&t=89)

During H2 production pyruvate breaks down into formate, which is used in methane production. H2 production also produces CO2, which is reduced into methane. Also, when hydrogen dehydrogenase reduces H2 into H+ it produces reduced cytochrome c3, which is then used to turn sulfite into H2S. The production of hydrogen gas will contribute to the production of both methane and hydrogen sulfide. 

[[bacterial gas flowchart.jpg]]

Opportunistic bacteria are often never alone, they have a propensity to help each other like e.coli and methanogenic archaea, one absorbing the hydrogen from the other and producing methane in its turn, responsible for an 85% decrease in the migrating motor complex

If your digestion is healthy nitrogen production occurs the most, followed by carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oxygen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. The predominant gases found or produced in the small intestine is nitrogen and carbon dioxide. If increased hydrogen, methane, or hydrogen sulfide gas is produced, you might be suffering from upper gut dysbiosis or SIBO.

## Sulfur Metabolism Theory
See [[Sulfur Metabolism Theory of SIBO]]

## Interventions
Treatment, in particular self-administered, may be long, spread over a year or more and composed of several treatment phases interspersed with breaks, in order for the body to recover (and for bacteria or microorganisms to become resensitized to antibiotics). There is no miracle recipe, some recommend cycles of treatments of one month, and some of them, other two months and still other three months (maximum) and others a series of 15-day cycles by changing plants over 8-9 weeks. In longstanding SIBO cases, biofilms are well installed and make the use of antibiotics ineffective, it is therefore necessary to treat as many times as necessary and to set up in precursor (but also if necessary during the treatment), an appropriate biofilm disruptor.

[Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth: Often-Ignored Cause of Irritable Bowel Syndrome](https://www.townsendletter.com/article/355-6-sibo-ibs-irritable-bowel-syndrome/) Allison Siebecker wrote some protocols here, basically Specific Carbohydrate Diet or Gut and Psychology Syndrome Diet + antibiotics + prokinetics.

[[SIBO treatment protocol.png]]

This protocol is designed mostly for hydrogen and methane. I think it was actually written before widespread knowledge that H2S was even a type. Lactulose testing will not show H2S SIBO, and protien content + amino acid profile will need to be taken into account for diet. Constant retesting with a Trio Smart Test isnt feasible bc insurance probably wont pay for it.

### Diet
The FODMAP Diet is not specifically designed for SIBO and therefore does not eliminate polysaccharide and disaccharide sources such as grains, starch, starchy vegetables, and sucrose. Eliminating these poly- and disaccharides is essential in SIBO because SIBO creates a situation in which these normally well-absorbed carbohydrates, foods that usually go to feed the host, can now feed bacteria inappropriately located in the small intestine, creating symptoms and worsening the problem

### Antibiotics
- Xifaxan ([Rifaximin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17520365/))
	- [Rifaximin (Xifaxan): Why It May or May Not Improve Your SIBO](https://www.fixyourgut.com/rifaximin-why-it-may-or-may-not-improve-your-sibo/)
		- needs [[Bile]] to work
		- inhibits NF-kb via the PXR gene, the same receptor that secondary bile acids activate
		- Interestingly, consuming [grapefruit fruit or juice](https://www.wellrx.com/xifaxan/lifestyle-interactions/#:~:text=Notes%20for%20Professionals%3A%20Advise%20patients,is%20a%20P%2Dgp%20inhibitor) while taking Rifaximin will significantly increase absorption, systemic circulation, and bodily concentration of the antibiotic.

	- didnt notice big change for me

### Anti-archaea
Archaea are resistant to antibiotics because the archaeal cell envelope differs profoundly in terms of chemical composition and structure from that of bacteria. Archaea are the only confirmed biological sources of methane in nature and _Methanobrevibacter smithii_ is the predominant methanogen in the human intestine. Killing archaea will require more wide scope antimicrobial herbal extracts, but these are also likely more caustic to the mucosal lining.

[Effects of antimicrobial peptides on methanogenic archaea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22585226/)
>All three tested methanoarchaea were highly sensitive against derivatives of human cathelicidin, of porcine lysin, and a synthetic antilipopolysaccharide peptide (Lpep); **however, sensitivities differed markedly among the methanoarchaeal strains.**

[Volatilisation of metals and metalloids: An inherent feature of methanoarchaea?](https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.syapm.2008.02.001)
methanoarchaea are able to transform metals into volatile derivatives, including bismuth and selenium

[[methanogen antimicrobial table.jpg]]


>Squalamine is also effective against human methanogens, with an MIC of 1 mg/L [5] (S. Khelaifia and M. Drancourt, unpublished data). Our electron microscopy observations suggest that squalamine breaks the M. smithii cell wall, inducing cytoplasm leakage and cell death by a mechanism similar to that observed for Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 2). Unpublished data from our laboratory indicate that human methanogens are susceptible to squalamine and some of its derivatives, with MICs between 0.1 and 1 mg/L (S. Khelaifia and M. Drancourt, unpublished data).

>treatment of the digestive tract with metronidazole in bone marrow transplant recipients eliminated detectable methanogens in stools: patients receiving metronidazole were negative for methanogen culture within the first week of therapy, and recolonization occurred within several weeks

>Reduced imidazole derivatives are biologically active products that bind to DNA regions rich in adenine and thymine and cause oxidative cleavage of DNA stretches
	- how safe is that?

>The elongation factor-G equivalent factor (elongation factor-2) of all of the methanogens surveyed was systematically inhibited by fusidic acid within the same range of effective concentrations as that affecting the functionally homologous factors of E. coli and S. cerevisiae, at an MIC of 0.5 mg/L [81], supporting the hypothesis that archaea are susceptible to molecules that are also active against bacteria and eukaryotes

### Biofilm
Biofilms form and evolve from early ("Phase-1" weaker) to later ("Phase-2" stronger) forms.

it is mainly the enzymes of serrapeptase type that attack the biofilm (fibrinolysis), preferably with enteric coating, dosed at 20,000 IU minimum.

For example:  
**Enzymedica SerraGold Serrapetase** 100,000 SPUS  
60 caps (60 – 120) 18.46 $  
NB: TheraBlend 80,000 HUT (associated with a mixture of proteolytic enzymes). The caps does not’ enteric coating but it is superfluous here according to the world leader (mixture complexed with trace elements). Ok.  
Or **Doctor's Best Proteolytic Enzymes**   120,000 SPUS.  
90 Caps. 19.24 $ (Blend enteric-coated)

**Serrapeptase** (or serra peptidase) – Serrapeptase is an enzyme produced by serratia bacteria in the intestines of silkworms. The enzyme only dissolves dead or damaged tissues such as fibrin, the building blocks of biofilm. Once the enzyme has dissolved fibrin, the bacteria are then exposed to the immune system and antibiotics. Distribute the capsules throughout the day. These should be taken at least 30 minutes before a meal (40’ to 60’) or after a meal (1H30 to 2H).  
Reference will be made to the dosage of the product and the manufacturer's indications. In some cases, entero-protected capsules will be needed to reach the 2nd part of the intestines.  
Serrapeptase also has an anti-inflammatory action in addition to dissolving the fibrinogenic compounds of "small fire" biofilms", it is metabolized and extends this anti-inflammatory activity to the arteries (the atheroma plaques being composed of 70% clacium and fibrin (dead tissue)), to the joints (arthritis/polyarthritis, etc, etc...) 4 Gels/day on an empty stomach.

may want to look into its effect on arteries and joints just in case

**Lumbrokinase** – Lumbrokinase is an enzyme produced by earthworms. It is commonly used to break down the biofilm by dissolving the fibrin that makes it up. Lumbrokinase is thought to be more potent than nattokinase.  


**Nattokinase** – Nattokinase is an enzyme produced from Natto, a Japanese food made from fermented soybeans. It is commonly used to break down the biofilm by dissolving the fibrin that makes it up.  

**Mixed enzymes** listed above with other compounds known for their effectiveness in digesting dead tissue: Bromelain, flavonoids or grapefruit extracts (e.g., hesperidin, resveratrol and naringenin), and, papain, boswellic’acid, NAC, amylase and glucoamylase, etc.

**Bismuth** - Phase 2 disruptor. Present in Pepto-bismol as bismuth salycate. Also comes in bismuth subnitrate. bismuth subnitrate is less effective against biofilms that accumulate iron. 

[BIOFILMS: WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM THE RESEARCH?](https://ndnr.com/gastrointestinal/biofilms-what-have-we-learned-from-the-research/)
Pathogenic biofilms exist on a continuum, from partially developed and less pathogenic Phase-1 biofilms to fully developed, complex, and more pathogenic Phase-2 biofilms. As the more complex biofilms are properly addressed, they regress to Phase-1 (where treatment can be diminished) and then continue on to the normal non-pathogenic phase (where they can be maintained by proper diet and an intact immune system).

### Prokinetics
- Enzymedica Gut Motility
	- Artichoke leaf + ginger extract
- Iberogast 
	- herbal product that includes chelidonium leaf, milk thistle fruit, lemon balm leaf, carum, licorice root, angelica root, chamomile flower, and peppermint leaf. A 2002 systematic review reported Iberogast to be equally as effective as prescription prokinetic agents for relieving functional gastrointestinal symptoms. via [[SIBO Clinician's Guide.pdf]]

### Microbiome Support
#### Probiotics
The majority of your good gut bacteria should be [in your large intestine: up to 1012](http://iai.asm.org/content/76/8/3360.full) bacteria per mL, compared to around [104 bacteria per mL in the small intestine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1450168/) Probiotics can be risky, as they may wind up increasing bacterial load in the stomach or small intestine if MMC are non-functional. Maybe necessary after antibiotic use to avoid gut getting recolonized by macrophages. Some potentially useful supps to restore gut biome after antibiotic use:
- [[Saccharomyces boulardii]]
	- antibiotic-resistant non-pathogenic yeast
	- can take w/ antibiotics to reduce chance of opportunistic growth
- L reuteri
	- L. Reuteri will colonize in the small intestine and in the stomach, which is something other probiotics do not do. [Colonization and Immunomodulation by Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 in the Human Gastrointestinal Tract](https://aem.asm.org/content/70/2/1176)
	- Dr Davis yogurt
		- can also be made with [coconut milk](https://drdavisinfinitehealth.com/2019/09/making-l-reuteri-yogurt-with-coconut-milk/)
	- does not belong in the stomach, but maybe okay for small intestine
	- Bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-active bacteria. produces the enzyme BSH that deconjugates [[bile]] acids into their more active antibacterial form.
	- Some strains produce histamine

### Low-Dose Naltrexone
- low-dose naltrexone
	- can block [[TLR-4]] receptor

## Further Notes
Ultimately, SIBO develops when 1 or more defense mechanisms against bacterial overgrowth become compromised. These defense mechanisms include hydrochloric acid to destroy bacteria in the stomach; gut motility to keep intestinal contents moving forward; immunoglobulins and pancreatic proteolytic enzymes to halt bacterial growth; and an intact ileocecal valve to prevent backflow of contents from the large intestine to the small intestine.

### Hormone Axis
Hormones matter: The host needs to stay anabolic to maintain the tight junction of enterocytes, the transit time must be maintained, and pathologic biota need to remain in the colon and not ascend to the small bowel - see [[Anabolics change the Microbiota and Reduces Symptoms of Gastrointestinal Disease?]] 

### Thiamine Axis
[When SIBO & IBS-Constipation are just unrecognized thiamine deficiency](https://www.eonutrition.co.uk/post/when-sibo-ibs-constipation-are-just-unrecognized-thiamine-deficiency)

[HDT Therapy](https://highdosethiamine.org/hdt-therapy/) meant for parkinsons but could be a template for sibo.
75–80 kg→35 mg/kg/day of thiamine hcl or one 100 mg/ml vial every 7 to 10 days.

#### Thiamine-Acetylcholine Relationship
Digestive distress burns through acetylcholine production. Acetylcholine activates peristalsis and the cleansing MMC waves which sweep bacteria to the large intestine. Low levels of acetylcholine may be due to [[B1 Thiamine]]deficiency, which is [necessary for the synthesis of acetylcholine](https://www.hormonesmatter.com/sibo-ibs-constipation-thiamine-deficiency/) Also, [thiamine inhibits inflammatory effect of endotoxin on leaky gut, and TTFD restores motility in poisoned animals intestines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17dBHmZBMM&t=6422s)

- as TTFD is allicin bound to thiamine, sulfur sensitivity will preclude you from its use, I found it to be too irritating just like allicin.
- the research generally suggests thiamine would most benefit constipation, as that would be the symptom associated with deficiency.
- tangentially, nicotine activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which induces gut motility and calms inflammation. May explain symptomatic relief some people get from smoking.

### Cholesterol - Endotoxin Axis
"Lipoproteins, especially HDL, bind to and neutralize lipopolysaccharide (LPS).” Vyroubal P, Chiarla C, Giovannini I, et al. Hypocholesterolemia in clinically serious conditions--review. Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2008

"Low cholesterol can be caused by intestinal inflammation, and starches are a common cause. Sweet potatoes are effective promoters of bacterial growth, rice and potatoes can cause gas especially if they aren't well cooked. When your cholesterol is so low, your body can't respond fully to a thyroid supplement. Thyroid should cause the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and the other neurosteroids, but when cholesterol is too low it just increases stress hormones instead." RP 2018

### Vagus Nerve Axis
Vagus nerve must be in parasympathetic state for MMC action.

### Managing Endotoxemia 
See [[Endotoxemia]]

### Genes
#### FUT2
FUT2 is an enzyme that makes it possible to manufacture 2-Fucosyllactose (2-FL) which is an oligosaccharide. This enzyme is involved in the functioning of the cells of the intestine and contributes to the secretions of the intestinal mucosa. 2-FL allows many species of bacteria in the microbiota to nest in the mucosa in order to’ ensure a good diversity of the microbiota.

20% of the Caucasian population has a genetic polymorphism that could affect the expression of this gene and thus secretion of this enzyme. Studies have suggested that the FUT 2 mutation contributes to a predisposition to develop inflammatory diseases of the’ intestine, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, etc, or rotavirus and norovirus infections by changing the composition of the gut microbiota.

PreforPro? It is a prebiotic bacteriophage that specifically targets e.coli.
SIBO/IBS D not C due to high histamine?

"In a very healthy person, maybe 10% of the population, the whole small intestine system is sterile. In another very sick 10 or 20%, microbes invade the small intestine, in extreme cases even into the stomach, by raising the pH of the stomach. In the absence of thyroid you can't make enough stomach acid [...] at an extreme the stomach becomes alkaline and bacteria such as H. pylori then thrive because they're alkaline loving. And some people will even develop a brewery containing yeast all the way up into their stomach so that if they eat carbohydrate, they'll have alcohol in their breath. That's all because of a very slow metabolic rate. So normalizing, optimizing your thyroid is going to give you a sterile stomach and small intestine. And the bacteria will live almost exclusively in the colon" RP 

"The small intestine, I think, is best when it's cleanest. Very vigorous people with good digestion and high thyroid function have almost a sterile small intestine from their mouth to their appendix, basically. There's nothing growing. So they get a chance to absorb all of the nutrients without competing with bacteria. Then in the healthy person, the bacteria grow just in the colon. So you don't want to support bacterial growth higher up in your intestine. The H. pylori is an example of (bacteria) much too high in the digestive system for bacteria to live." RP kmud-161216-food

Discussion Excerpts:
>Klebsiella is a known culprit in many SIBO cases in the United States, Klebsiella is also a very hard form of bacteria to kill. In fact, it might surprise you to know that some Pubmed studies show that Rifaximin would cause Klebsiella to multiply; exacerbating the underlying problem. It is my personal theory that cases of treatment-resistant SIBO are actually due not to slowed intestinal motility, but by the failure to adequately treat the pathogenic bacteria causing the issue.

>the next thing I would recommend doing is talking to your doctor about ordering the GI MAP test so you might get an idea of the exact culprit. The GI MAP includes not only a measurement of the specific bacteria strains in your gut, but also a readout of the antibiotic resistance genes within those bacteria.

>there's concerns about if it is at all representative for cultures in small intestine or just for colon.
