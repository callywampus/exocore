# NAFLD
Lipid inflammation cycle + LA -> bad outcome :) 
A1 -> inflammation. A2 -> no inflammation. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-013-0606-7因(https://t.co/s48DuIvKTY) 

Inflammation -> CD36 -> lipid (esp. oxidized) uptake by hepatocytes and macrophages -> NASH [https://nature.com/articles/s41419-020-03003-w因(https://t.co/rIRXlT7v9B) 

LA intake -> oxLDL increases [https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915019314200因(https://t.co/cI7gRAy0OI) 

CD36 takes up oxLDL -> oxylipins increase (in macrophages, but in liver too?) [https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231717307188因(https://t.co/LFgcv2yiOU) 

Oxylipins -> inflammation. More lipids taken up. Fatty , full liver. QED Fructose bypasses insulin signaling and quickly gives energy to the liver. If the liver is already "full" (inflamed, full of fats), fructose is going to cause an energy excess and DNL.
