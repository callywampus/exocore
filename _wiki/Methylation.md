# Methylation
Methylation in the context of DNA refers to the addition of a methyl group (CH3) to the DNA molecule, typically at the 5th carbon of the cytosine ring within a CpG dinucleotide (where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide in the DNA sequence). This process is catalyzed by enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases.

The methylation of DNA is a key epigenetic mechanism that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression. When methyl groups are added to certain parts of a gene's promoter region, they can change the gene's activity without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Generally, increased methylation of gene promoters is associated with the repression of gene expression, as the methyl groups can inhibit the binding of transcription factors and other proteins necessary for initiating transcription.

In the context of development and differentiation, DNA methylation patterns are established and modified to ensure that the right genes are expressed at the right times and in the right cells. These patterns are usually stable and inherited through cell division, contributing to the maintenance of cellular identity.

However, aberrant DNA methylation patterns can contribute to diseases, including cancer. In tumors, tumor-suppressor genes can become hypermethylated at their promoter regions, leading to their silencing and the loss of their growth-regulating functions. Conversely, oncogenes may become hypomethylated, leading to their overexpression.

The study of DNA methylation and cancer therapy has led to the development of drugs that can modify these methylation patterns. DNA-demethylating agents, such as certain less toxic compounds like procaine and orally administered drugs like zebularine, have been explored for their potential to reactivate silenced tumor-suppressor genes as a therapeutic strategy.

Moreover, environmental factors, including diet, stress, and exposure to toxins, can influence DNA methylation patterns. For example, certain nutrients and drugs can promote the removal of methyl groups from DNA or affect the acetylation of histones, another key epigenetic modification that influences gene expression.

In summary, DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification that has significant implications for gene regulation, development, cellular differentiation, and disease, particularly cancer. Understanding and manipulating methylation patterns hold promise for therapeutic interventions in various diseases.
