# Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs)

Nomenclature of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300810570

Electromagnetic fields act _via_ activation of voltage-gated calcium channels to produce beneficial or adverse effects https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.12088

alternating magnetic fields can affect calcium’s movement through the cells by different mechanisms, depending on the frequency and intensity of the fields. One possible mechanism is by activating **temperature-sensitive ion channels**, such as TRPV1, which are selective calcium transporters. [When magnetic nanoparticles or paramagnetic proteins are attached to these channels and heated by an alternating magnetic field, they can stimulate the opening of the channels and allow calcium influx into the cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetogenetics)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetogenetics). Another possible mechanism is by inducing **electric fields and currents** in the cells, which can alter the membrane potential and affect the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels. [These channels are also selective calcium transporters that open and close in response to changes in membrane potential](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961218301170)[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961218301170). A third possible mechanism is by influencing the **electron spin** of free radicals, such as nitric oxide, which can modulate the activity of calcium-dependent enzymes, such as guanylate cyclase. [This enzyme produces cyclic GMP, which can regulate the intracellular calcium levels by affecting the release of calcium from internal stores or the uptake of calcium by mitochondria](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-9-47)[3](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-9-47).”
