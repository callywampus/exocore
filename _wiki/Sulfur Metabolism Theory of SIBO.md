# Sulfur Metabolism Theory of SIBO
If there are issues with my sulfur metabolism, it is possible that my body my will wind up with a buildup of inorganic sulfate and/or sulfite. A buildup of either of these is undesirable, as sulfate must be activated into phosphosulfate before it can be used for the sulfation process,<sup>1</sup> which is essential for survival, and sulfite is well known to be quite cytotoxic.<sup>2</sup> They are meant to be an intermediaries, NOT meant to be accumulated. Sulfate that does not get utilized is likely excreted in the urine.<sup>3</sup> So a buildup of sulfate and/or sulfite is useless at best, and dangerous at worst!

So, how does the body respond when primary sulfur metabolism is compromised?

Enter Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria(SRB). These bacteria can metabolize sulfate and sulfite to create hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide produced in the gut may be directly absorbed into circulation and diffuse through tissues, where it is oxidized into the necessary sulfate. In fact, the primary pathway for H2S clearance is via intracellular sulfide oxidation.<sup>4</sup>

I am seriously entertaining the idea that a bottleneck in my sulfur metabolism has caused my body to "allow" an overgrowth of SRB as a sort of "backup" sulfur metabolism. This theory is the best explanation I have that addresses a single causative mechanism for multiple health issues: my intolerance to certain supplements, my reactions to certain foods, and the SIBO that reoccurs despite multiple rounds of treatment.

"**H2S production by gut microbiota** presents itself as an interesting line of study to explore the effect of bacteria-derived effector molecules affecting host physiology and pathophysiology. Sulfide reducing bacteria (SRB) represent a major class of the normal gut microbiota ([173](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/#R173)). The predominant genera residing in gut are _Desulfovibrio_, _Desulfobacter_, _Desulfolobus_, _and Desulfotomaculum_. SRBs are the major contributors of nonenzymatic H2S produced in the human body ([174](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/#R174)).

[Sulfate and Sulfur Reduction](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Microbiology_%28Boundless%29/05%3A_Microbial_Metabolism/5.09%3A_Anaerobic_Respiration/5.9C%3A_Sulfate_and_Sulfur_Reduction)
>Most sulfate-reducing bacteria can also reduce other oxidized inorganic sulfur compounds, such as **sulfite**, thiosulfate, or elemental sulfur (which is reduced to sulfide as hydrogen sulfide).


"We summarized from this review that there is strong interplay between perturbed gut microbiota in IBD, and the consistently higher abundance of sulfur-containing metabolites, which potentially represent substrates for sulfidogenic bacteria such as _Bilophila_ or _Escherichia_ and promote their growth. These bacteria might shift their metabolism towards the degradation of taurine and cysteine and therefore to a higher hydrogen sulfide production." - [The role of fecal sulfur metabolome in inflammatory bowel diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438422121000424?via%3Dihub)

#### Sulfur-Histamine Axis
Sulfite, the aqueous ion of sulfur dioxide, induces cellular activation, leading to degranulation in mast cells through a non-IgE-dependent pathway. The response also differs from IgE-mediated degranulation in that it is insensitive to the influx of extracellular calcium. The putative pathway seems to rely on activation of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex, leading to intracellular oxidative stress.

## Testing the Theory
Options:
1. The bottleneck is sulfate -> PAPS conversion
	1. sulfate deficiency implicates SUOX
	2. 
2. the bottleneck is sulfite -> sulfate conversion
	1. SUOX 
		 - Molybdenum deficiency: The common herbicide Glyphosate (Roundup) is a potent chelator of molybdenum.
		- Glyphosate substitution for glycine in protein synthesis: The SUOX enzyme contains critical glycine residues which could theoretically be replaced by glyphosate during protein synthesis - a process which may render the SUOX enzyme dysfunctional.
		- Mercury and Lead toxicity: These interfere with enzyme function.
		- SUOX genetic polymorphism: A single nucleotide polymorphism in the SUOX gene may interfere with the speed and efficiency by which this enzyme can perform its function.
3. the bottleneck is something else in the cystine metabolism or methylation pathway that is interfering with the sulfite -> sulfate -> PAPS conversion
		- glutathione taurine riboflavin and other trace minerals related to Mo

what blood tests are associates with sulfation?


### Blood/Urine/Hair tests
#### Glyphosate

#### Molybdenum
Tests for molybdenum are not usually included as a part of a trace mineral panel, a doc needs to order it specifically. I have not found a place to order bloods yet. 

Hair testing can be ordered from a bunch of places but Im pretty sure they all come from the same [Doctor's Data](https://www.doctorsdata.com/hair-elements/) test. I have seen reviews say they never received results, which gives me pause. Haidut used to offer a hair mineral test but doesnt anymore. I wonder if its because he was using the same provider and they were inconsistent.

#### Trace Minerals


#### Phenols
Upregulated P-Cresol(aka 4-methylphenol) and HPHPA will indicate phenols are being used to transport sulfate trough the blood. This would mean different things:
- sulfite is being successfully oxidized into sulfate, at least to an extent, but that sulfate is not being activated into phosphosulfate(PAPS). 
- this is free sulfate in the blood, already activated? but then why does it need to be transported by phenols to the liver?
- could sulfur containing compounds from H2S complicate this reading?

It is unlikely to actually find someone who can do this test.

#### Uric acid
In the event a molybdenum test is not available, a uric acid test could be used as a proxy. Low levels of uric acid would mean a potential molybdenum deficiency, as the enzyme necessary for its synthesis, xanthine oxidase, requires molybdenum as a cofactor. blood tests for uric acid usually have to be ordered by a practitioner but urine tests can be found online.

### Relevant Genetic Snips:
SUOX
- molybdenum cofactor
Cystathionine-Beta-Synthase (CBS)
- link between methylation and sulfation pathways
NOS3
- endothelial nitric oxide synthase
- sulfur metabolism generates ammonia
- ammonia detoxified via urea cycle
- urea cycle involves NO synthase
- urea cycle and methylation cycle meet during production of dopamine
- possibly involved in non-endothelial sulfate production
- **mediated by red light?**
	- During night it produces NO, during day under infrared it changes to sulfate producer

>At the same time, it is recommended that people take at least 2-3 baths with 4 cups of epsom salts per week. Epsom salts contain both magnesium and sulfate. **Trans-dermal sulfate bypasses the gut (where it would usually be converted into hydrogen sulfide), and so is an effective way to deliver sulfate without experiencing symptoms caused by the hydrogen sulfide**. After two weeks of sulfur-exclusion, people gradually can introduce sulfur containing foods one by one whilst simultaneously supporting the sulfur pathway with the supplements. **This approach has apparently benefited people with both hydrogen and methane dominant SIBO.** 

On initial reading the bath idea does not seem sound because small, uncharged, lipophilic molecules pass through skin easier than large, charged, hydrophilic molecules. Inorganic sulfate ion is a large, negatively charged, and highly water-soluble molecule, which means it has low skin permeability and may not be able to cross the skin barrier.

However:
[Report on Absorption of magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) across the skin](https://www.epsomsaltcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/report_on_absorption_of_magnesium_sulfate.pdf)
- RH Waring conducted a study with 19 healthy subjects. He found that using 400 grams (about 4 cups) of Epsom salt and soaking for 20 minutes nightly for 7 nights in a row increased sulfate levels in the blood to a steady state.
- "In other experiments using excised human skin, we found that sulfate does penetrate across the skin barrier. This is quite rapid so probably involves a sulfate transporter protein."
- "These proteins are not well understood or described but, at least for sulfate, they are believed to be high affinity but low capacity."

"Certain sulfur containing thermal water baths have been found to be of benefit, probably via transdermal penetration or because of actual drinking of such waters at health spas [[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2198910/#B21),[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2198910/#B52)-[55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2198910/#B55)]." - [Are we getting enough sulfur in our diet?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2198910/)

>Another key point is to avoid glyphosate at all costs! This means to eat organic where ever possible. When organic is not an option, at least stay away from foods heavily sprayed with glyphosate - corn soy, wheat, chickpeas, lentils etc. **It may also be advisable to get tested for glyphosate contamination.** Similarly, heavy metal toxicity may also be a contributing factor. If you suspect that to be the case, then would be wise to undertake necessary steps in that direction (testing and chelation under the supervision of a knowledgeable a practitioner).

#### Contra nigh
According to [excerpts](https://raypeatforum.com/community/threads/problems-with-sulphur.24824/post-355864) of the review study [Sulfur Cycling and the Intestinal Microbiome](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10620-017-4689-5) the idea of avoiding most food sources of sulfur possible in attempt to solve this issue goes down the drain because **even if you fasted, there are still bile compounds and mucusal lining that will keep a steady supply for them**. In extreme cases, if you were to avoid something, it must be animal proteins for a while since they are the major source of sulfur in people's diets. Some inevitably escapes digestion, esp if digestion is impaired, and considering their high sulfur content, this small portion can be a lot for someone with an infection.

The rest of the protocol looks good though

Trans-dermal sulfate bypasses the gut (and therefore SUOX and SRB), and so is an effective way to deliver sulfate without experiencing symptoms caused by the hydrogen sulfide or sulfite overload. However, if the issue is making the inorganic sulfate -> PAPS conversion then this would exacerbate things.

## Literature Overview
Koch (above and in his writings in general) was always cautious about selenium compounds. At first I thought it was due to some environmental excess at his time or where he lived, but later I realized that it's because intestinal bactaeria can act on them as replacement for sulfur. - via [Amazoniac](https://raypeatforum.com/community/threads/problems-with-sulphur.24824/post-438533)

"Kinetic studies indicate that selenate and selenite share a single transporter with sulfate" https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/ecosalplus.3.6.1.11


- Check your homocysteine levels: a build up of sulfur containing amino acid will push homocysteine down transsulfuration pathway vs recycling back to methionine
- B6 and iron are involved in many enzym in this pathway so make sure those are sufficient.
- Thiamine binds to excess sulfite so ensure B1 levels are sufficient so your gut doesn’t need to encode more sulfate reducing bacteria


Cysteine can be cytotoxic since the reactive thiol-amine structure can combine with aldehydes such as pyridoxal, and can also chelate essential divalent cations. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2198910/

Higher concentrations of cysteine are potentially dangerous to  
cells since cysteine forms a thiazolidine derivative with pyridoxal phos-  
phate and thereby may deplete cells of that coenzyme. [[griffith1987.pdf]]

Excess H2S can cause all kinds of issues

[Hydrogen Sulfide Produced by Gut Bacteria May Induce Parkinson's Disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35326429/)

## PAPS and Bile Acid
Sulfation is necessary for bile acid production. Bile acid production is not possible without PAPS, as PAPS is the essential sulfate donor for the sulfation of bile acid precursors. Sulfation is a key step in the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, as it increases the solubility and excretion of the intermediates[1](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/bile-acid-synthesis-disorders/)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_acid)[3](https://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/48/9/742)

Without PAPS, bile acid synthesis would be impaired, leading to the accumulation of cholesterol and toxic intermediates in the liver and blood. This could cause cholestasis, liver damage, and other complications[1](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/bile-acid-synthesis-disorders/)

PAPS is generated from ATP and sulfate in the cytosol by the enzymes ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase[1](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/bile-acid-synthesis-disorders/)[4](https://www.liverdoctor.com/things-you-must-know-you-dont-have-gallbladder/) Therefore, bile acid production depends on the availability of these substrates and enzymes.

ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase are enzymes involved in the synthesis of 3’-phosphoadenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which is the universal sulfate donor for sulfation reactions [Expression of enzymes for 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthesis and their preparation for PAPS synthesis and regeneration](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-020-10709-6) Expression of enzymes for 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) biosynthesis and their preparation for PAPS synthesis and regeneration.

Some important cofactors for ATP sulfurylase are:

- **Mg2+**, which is required for the binding and catalysis of ATP and sulfate The role of magnesium in the enzymatic synthesis of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate.
- **Reduced glutathione (GSH)**, which is a thiol-containing compound that can modulate the activity and stability of ATP sulfurylase Glutathione-dependent stabilization of ATP sulfurylase from Penicillium chrysogenum.
- **Reduced ferredoxin (Fd red)**, which is an electron carrier that can reduce the sulfite intermediate to sulfide, enhancing the reaction rate and yield Sulfite reduction by reduced ferredoxin in the biosynthesis of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate.

Some important cofactors for APS kinase are:

- **Mg2+**, which is also required for the binding and catalysis of ATP and APS Crystal structure of adenylylsulfate kinase from Penicillium chrysogenum.
- **ADP**, which is the by-product of APS kinase reaction and can act as an allosteric inhibitor, regulating the enzyme activity and PAPS level Adenylylsulfate kinase from Penicillium chrysogenum: purification, characterization, and inhibition by its reaction product adenosine 5′-diphosphate.





### Interrelated Theories
#### Glutathione deficiency backup theory
"I don't think taking molybdenum will solve it, although a diet without enough organ meats, leafy greens and seeds (legumes, whole grains and nuts) might be deficient indeed. Not only from the risk of causing further imbalances, I just posted elsewhere for example that joint problems is a common adverse effect from higher intakes (environmental exposure or supplementation); but also because if the body allowed bactaeria that thrive on sulfur to grow, molybdenum will make the situation worse because some of them need it for similar enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism.  
  
DMSO and sulfate (as magnesium sulfate for example) might provide relief, but if a molybdenum deficiency is involved, those will make it worse over time.  
  
Avoiding those foods altogether is probably not a good idea if the overgrowth was compensatory because it will either go into dormancy and become more resistant, or send the signal to the body that more overgrowth is desirable. However, reducing the intake is worth considering and trying to add other fermentable foods that won't support their growth (there are plenty of them).  
  
Here's a good starting the places..  
  

[Glutathione Depletion/Methylation Blockades in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](https://phoenixrising.me/research-2/glutathione-depletionmethylation-blockades-in-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/a-simple-explanation-of-the-glutathionemethylation-depletion-theory-of-mecfs-by-rich-von-konynenburg)  
  
1. To get an isolated case of CFS (I’m not talking here about the epidemics or clusters), you have to have inherited some genetic variations from your parents. These are called polymorphisms or single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We know what some of the important ones are, but we don’t know all of them yet. This is a topic that needs more research.  
  
2. You also have to have **some things happen in your life that place demands on your supply of glutathione**. Glutathione is like a very small protein, and there is some in every cell of your body, and in your blood. **It protects your body from quite a few things that can cause problems, including chemicals that are toxic, and oxidizing free radicals. It also helps the immune system to fight bugs (bacteria, viruses, fungi) so that you are protected from infections by them.**  
  
3. **Oxidizing free radicals are molecules that have an odd number of electrons, and are very chemically reactive. They are normally formed as part of the metabolism in the body, but if they rise to high levels and are not eliminated by glutathione and the rest of the antioxidant system, they will react with things they shouldn’t, and cause problems.** This situation is called oxidative stress, and it is probably the best-proven biochemical aspect of chronic fatigue syndrome.  
  
4. There are a variety of things in your life that can place demands on your glutathione. These include physical injuries or surgery to your body, exposure to toxic chemicals such as pesticides, solvents, or heavy metals like mercury, arsenic or lead, exposure to infectious agents or vaccinations, or emotional stress that causes secretion of a lot of cortisol and adrenaline, especially if it continues over a long time. **Just about anything that “stresses” your body or your mind will place a demand on glutathione. All people experience a variety of stressors all the time, and a healthy person’s body is able to keep up with the demands for glutathione by recycling used glutathione molecules and by making new ones as needed. However, if a person’s body cannot keep up, either because of extra-high demands or inherited genetic polymorphisms that interfere with recycling or making glutathione, or both, the levels of glutathione in the cells can go too low.** When glutathione is properly measured in most people with CFS (such as in the Vitamin Diagnostics methylation pathways panel), it is found to be below normal.  
  
5. **One of the jobs that glutathione normally does is to protect your supply of vitamin B12 from reacting with toxins. If left unprotected, vitamin B12 is very reactive chemically. If it reacts with toxins, it can’t be used for its important jobs in your body. A routine blood test for vitamin B12 will not reveal this problem. In fact, many people with CFS appear to have elevated levels of B12 in their blood, while their bodies are not able to use it properly.** The best test to reveal this is a urine organic acids test that includes methylmalonic acid. It will be high if the B12 is being sidetracked, and this is commonly seen in people with CFS.  
  
6. **When your glutathione level goes too low, your B12 becomes naked and vulnerable, and is hijacked by toxins. Also, the levels of toxins rise in the body when there isn’t enough glutathione to take them out, so there are two unfortunate things that work together to sabotage your B12 when glutathione goes too low.**  
  
7. The most important job that B12 has in the body is to form methylcobalamin, which is one of the two active forms of B12. This form is needed by the enzyme methionine synthase, to do its job. An enzyme is a substance that catalyzes, or encourages, a certain biochemical reaction.  
  
8. **When there isn’t enough methylcobalamin, methionine synthase has to slow down its reaction. Its reaction lies at the junction of the methylation cycle and the folate cycle, so when this reaction slows down, it affects both these cycles.**  
  
9. The methylation cycle is found in all the cells of the body (not counting the red blood cells, which are unusual in a lot of ways). The methylation cycle has some important jobs to do. First, it acts as a little factory to supply methyl (CH3) groups to a large number of reactions in the body. Some of these reactions make things like creatine, carnitine, coenzyme Q10, phosphatidylcholine, melatonin, and lots of other important substances for the body. It is not a coincidence that these substances are found to be low in CFS, so that people try taking them as supplements. Not enough of them is being made because of the partial block in the methylation cycle. The methylation cycle also supplies methyl groups to be attached to DNA molecules, and this helps to determine whether the blueprints in the DNA will be used to make certain proteins according to their patterns. The “reading” of DNA is referred to as “gene expression.” Methyl groups prevent or “silence” gene expression. Overexpression of genes has been observed in CFS patients, and I suspect this is at least partly due to lack of sufficient methylation to silence gene expression.  
  
10. **Another thing that the methylation cycle does is to regulate the overall use of sulfur in the body. Sulfur comes in from the diet in the form of amino acids in protein (methionine and cysteine) and as taurine and some as sulfate. The methylation cycle regulates the production of the various substances that contain sulfur that are needed by the body.** The levels of various sulfur metabolites are often found to be abnormal in people with CFS.  
  
11. One of the most important sulfur-containing substances in the body is glutathione, so now you can see how this is starting to look like a dog chasing its tail! The thing that causes chronic fatigue syndrome to be chronic, and keeps people ill for years and years, is this interaction between glutathione, vitamin B12, and the methylation cycle. **When glutathione goes too low, the effect on vitamin B12 slows down the methylation cycle too much. The sulfur metabolites are then dumped into the transsulfuration pathway (which is connected to the methylation cycle) too much, are oxidized to form cystine, pass through hydrogen sulfide, and are eventually converted to thiosulfate and sulfate and are excreted in the urine. This lowers the production of glutathione, which requires cysteine rather than cystine, and now there is a vicious circle mechanism that preserves this malfunction and keeps you sick.**​

I would consider replenishing B-vitamins (especially niacin; thiamine and biotin shouldn't be too troubling as the situation improves), glycine, vitamin C, magnesium in low doses spread throughout the day (excess isn't absorbed and can fuel certain infections). The quinones must be useful as well because these sulfur compounds tend to inactivate them. If these continue to cause problems when ingested, topical is an alternative.

==**So backup theory is that root cause of sulfur issues and therefore SIBO is a glutathione deficiency**==

read somewhere that peat doesnt like methylation but idk

perhaps glutathione production competes with sulfate synthesis for cystine?

"Cysteine is also easily oxidized nonenzymatically to cystine (reaction 17), an insoluble  
amino acid which is toxic if allowed to accumulate (c.f. cystinosis). 68 The multiple pathways of cysteine catabolism function efficiently to prevent toxic accumulations of cysteine. Glutathione biosynthesis (reactions 13 and 14) serves, in part, to preserve a pool of cysteine in a nontoxic, metabolically active form that can be easily transported between organs."

Glutathione synthesis creates sulfite byproduct?

Thiosulfate production could also be promoted by GSH depletion, which would favor the use of sulfite instead of GSH as an acceptor for SQOR. GSH-depleted rat hepatocytes incubated with Cys exhibited severely impaired rates of sulfate production but higher rates of thiosulfate production compared with GSH-replete cells ([144](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622024233#bib144)).
