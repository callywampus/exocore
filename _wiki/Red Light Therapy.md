# Red Light Therapy
Red Light therapy works by enhancing the metabolism of individual cells. It helps shift the cell toward efficient, oxidative metabolism rather than the primitive metabolism of yeast, aerobic glycolysis, which is the "fallback" option when the cell undergoes stress.

It does this by unbinding NO from cytochrome c oxidase, which is like unblocking a dammed river to improve its flow. For more information on the mechanism, I recommend "Red Light Therapy: Miracle Medicine" by Mark Sloan
