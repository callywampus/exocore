"The small intestine, I think, is best when it's cleanest. Very vigorous people with good digestion and high thyroid function have almost a sterile small intestine from their mouth to their appendix, basically. There's nothing growing. So they get a chance to absorb all of the nutrients without competing with bacteria. Then in the healthy person, the bacteria grow just in the colon. So you don't want to support bacterial growth higher up in your intestine. The H. pylori is an example of (bacteria) much too high in the digestive system for bacteria to live." RP kmud-161216-food

"In a very healthy person, maybe 10% of the population, the whole small intestine system is sterile. In another very sick 10 or 20%, microbes invade the small intestine, in extreme cases even into the stomach, by raising the pH of the stomach. In the absence of thyroid you can't make enough stomach acid [...] at an extreme the stomach becomes alkaline and bacteria such as H. pylori then thrive because they're alkaline loving. And some people will even develop a brewery containing yeast all the way up into their stomach so that if they eat carbohydrate, they'll have alcohol in their breath. That's all because of a very slow metabolic rate. So normalizing, optimizing your thyroid is going to give you a sterile stomach and small intestine. And the bacteria will live almost exclusively in the colon" RP
