# Gilotoxin Research Dump
[Regulation of gliotoxin biosynthesis and protection in _Aspergillus_ species](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen-1009965-g010)

>GT is a sulfur-containing mycotoxin, a member of the epipolythiopiperazines, produced by different fungal species, including _Gliocadium fimbriatum_ (from which it was originally isolated and named accordingly), _A_. _fumigatus_ and closely related non-pathogenic species [[25](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref025),[26](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref026)], and also by species of _Trichoderma_ and _Penicillium_ [[27](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref027)–[30](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref030)].

>GT biosynthesis is tightly regulated because it interferes with and depends on several cellular pathways that regulate sulfur metabolism [cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met)], oxidative stress defenses [glutathione (GSH) and ergothioneine (EGT)], methylation [S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)], and iron metabolism (Fe–S clusters) [[31](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref031)–[35](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref035)].

> Even though the regulation of GT biosynthesis is well characterized, regulation of endogenous protection from GT—**which is also highly toxic to the fungus**—is less well understood.... GliT produces the final toxic form of GT by catalysing disulphide bridge closure of the precursor dithiol gliotoxin (dtGT) [[30](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref030),[37](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref037)]. However, if there is excess GT production, GliT is able to reduce GSH and produce dtGT attenuating GT toxicity [[30](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref030),[37](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009965#pgen.1009965.ref037)].

So GT is toxic, not just to the host but to the fungus itself, because it disrupts sulfur + associated pathways. The mechanisms of action by which GT disrupts those pathways in the fungus could give us clues on how it disrupts those pathways in the host

> dithiol gliotoxin (DTG) (a GT precursor) possesses potent Zn2+ chelation properties which positions this sulfur-containing metabolite as a putative component of the Zn2+ homeostasis system within fungi.


[Gilotoxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliotoxin)

>The immunosuppressive properties of gliotoxin are due to the [disulfide bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide_bridge "Disulfide bridge") within its structure. Interactions occur between [sulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") molecules that make up the disulfide bridge and [thiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thio- "Thio-") groups contained in [cysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine "Cysteine") residues. Gliotoxin acts by blocking thiol residues in the [cell membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane "Cell membrane").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliotoxin#cite_note-ArV-14) Gliotoxin also activates a member of the [Bcl-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2 "Bcl-2") family called [Bak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2_homologous_antagonist_killer "Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer") in order to mediate cell apoptosis. Activated Bak then causes the release of ROS, which form [pores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel_pore "Ion channel pore") within the [mitochondrial membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_membrane "Mitochondrial membrane"). These pores allow the release of [cytochrome C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_C "Cytochrome C") and [AIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis-inducing_factor "Apoptosis-inducing factor"), which initiate apoptosis within the cell.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliotoxin#cite_note-Pardo2006-16)

GT create ROS thus increasing need for GSH, but how does that promote SRB growth? GT is bacteriostatic and competes w SRB for the same substrate.

GT is bacteriostatic

> Gliotoxins show cytotoxic effects via the suppression the function of macrophage immune function, inflammation, antiangiogenesis, DNA damage by ROS production, peroxide damage by the inhibition of various enzymes, and apoptosis through different signal pathways.

> Gliotoxin was firstly isolated in Trichoderma virens [[7](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/24/13510/htm#B7-ijms-22-13510)] and then was found in other fungi, including A. fumigatus [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/24/13510/htm#B2-ijms-22-13510)], Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Eurotium chevalieri, and other Penicillium and Acremonium species [[14](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/24/13510/htm#B14-ijms-22-13510)].

> The sulfur bond is important for the toxicity of gliotoxins.
