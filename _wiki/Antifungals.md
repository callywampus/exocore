# Antifungals
>-- Really Good --  
>  
>(1) Coconut Oil -- Yes, good old organic refined CO taken by the gob does kill GI fungus. 2 or 3 big heaping tablespoons per day caused GI upset with the net result of purging visible fungi. Moreover, 6-1 solution of CO with Limonene is great for skin fungi. Also add some extra virgin olive oil for flavor.  
>
>(2) Borax -- Yes the greatly disparaged borax regimen. I've taken as much as 1/4 teaspoon for 3 three weeks at a time. I'm now down to a lower level and only have borax as my taste dictates. (A borax note. Henkel, a German company, definitely owns 20 Mule Team. It's now on the box. The labeling used to state that the product was 100% borax. There are no longer any ingredients listed on the packaging. I would avoid 20 Mule Team and get some "organic" borax from Amazon.)  
>  
>(3) Turpentine -- I'm talking "organic" gum spirits of turpentine that is distilled pine-tree resin (alpha-pinene and beta-pinene). Many terpenes are anathema to Candida and other fungi. I started turpentine first mixed with castor oil and then with sugar cubes. It's very effective. I've reduced the frequency of taking turpentine to 1 or 2 times a month.  
>  
>(4) Limonene -- Another terpene, which provides the orange smell in orange peel, can be taken internally (gel caps available) or used on the skin against fungal overgrowth. This one smells and tastes great!  
>  
>(5) Riboflavin, B2 -- This was the knock-out punch for me! When I added riboflavin to my protocol, my GI tract went into healthy smooth mode. My energy increased to a constant near-euphoric state. No other B vitamins please. 10+ mg riboflavin (daily) is all I'm currently taking.  
>  
>(6) Lugol's Iodine -- Fungi seem to cultivate an environment that behooves the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and it may be that many of the symptoms associated with fungal overgrowth actually come from endotoxins, not mycotoxins. I used Lugol's and it cleared up my chronic bronchitis and helped ramp up my metabolic energy. Moreover, iodine is somewhat anti-fungal, while antibiotics are generally pro-fungal. Before resorting to an antibiotic, I now try high-dose iodine to see if it takes care of an infection.  
>  
>(7) Red Light -- I have two of the Red Rush (RR) 360 units and do 6-minutes on each body side at ~1 meter distance. It definitely adds to metabolic energy and consequently helps me fight off infection and parasites. No comparison between a flood lamp bulb and the RR. When the RR arrived in the afternoon, my wife and I tried it and neither one of us could sleep that night. Very potent! The down side is the cost.  
>  
>-- The Sketchy, The Bad, and The Ugly --  
>  
>(1) Fluconazole (Diflucan) -- It helps but with a metabolic downside. You shouldn't take much and you shouldn't take it for very long. It interferes with cytochrome P450, which is difficult on the liver. I noticed cold hands while using Fluconazole. Moreover, it wasn't enough to cure my problems on its own.  
> 
>(2) Nystatin -- For whatever reason, I was disappointed with Nystatin products. What's good is that Nystatin is not absorbed and flushes through the GI tract. In my case, it wasn't a solution. If you can get gobs of Nystatin, it's worth a try.  
>  
>(3) Diets -- Don't get rid of Candida with a diet. You'll regret it! Whether it's a "Candida" diet, ketogenic, low-carb, or carnivore, you will not kill fungi this way. As Ray mentioned, when you starve fungi, they turn into their pathogenic form and send hyphae (like roots) into your intestines and colon. Now the problem is exponentially worse than before. Fasting, or in my case a ketogenic diet, eventually led to worse-than-ever Candida overgrowth.  
>  
>(4) MCT -- I didn't find that a good MCT product was any more effective than the cheaper organic refined coconut oil.  
>  
>(5) Sulfur -- Yes, I tried flowers of sulfur. It just made my gut gurgle and I smelled like rotten eggs. Nothing more to say.  
>  
>(6) Carvacrol -- This is the terpenoid (an alcohol?) found in oregano oil, which makes oregano oil useful against fungi. Chemically, it's related to turpentine and limonene. I haven't tried it yet, but it seems like it should be useful.  
>  
>(7) Menthol -- Everyone knows the smell of menthol. It too is a terpenoid (an alcohol) and seems to be effective for inhaling and even mixed in small amounts with turpentine for oral use. Careful around the eyes. It's very irritating! I am experimenting with organic menthol crystals, which are lipophilic. Not definite results yet.  
>  
>(8) Terpenoids -- My observation is that the plant kingdom produces all sorts of terpenoids as a protection against fungi, parasites, and bacteria. I'll be there are other non-toxic terpenoids that can be useful against fungal overgrowth.

## Butyrate
- that candida and other yeasts are killed or inhibited by butyrate  
- that butyrate is usually produced by balanced gut bacteria, but low levels are seen in IBD, Parkinsons, etc  
- supplementing butyrate can encourage growth of these normal species  
- that sodium butyrate is used as a part of treatment for these illnesses, along with "mold detox"  
  
There was a form of slow release sodium butyrate that apparently made sure the butyrate made it to the colon, as opposed to other forms.
