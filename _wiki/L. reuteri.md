# L. reuteri
- [[Lactobacillus]] strain
- L. Reuteri will colonize in the small intestine and in the stomach, which is something not all probiotics do. [Colonization and Immunomodulation by Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 in the Human Gastrointestinal Tract](https://aem.asm.org/content/70/2/1176)
- Dr Davis yogurt
		- can also be made with [coconut milk](https://drdavisinfinitehealth.com/2019/09/making-l-reuteri-yogurt-with-coconut-milk/)
- does not belong in the stomach, but maybe okay for small intestine
- Bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-active bacteria. produces the enzyme BSH that deconjugates [[bile]] acids into their more active antibacterial form.
- Some strains produce [[histamine]]
	- histamine suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production
	- suppression was dependent on the activation of histamine H2 receptor, increased intracellular cAMP and protein kinase A, and the inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling
	- strain 6475
	- "Histamine from _L. reuteri_ 6475 stimulated increased levels of cAMP, which inhibited downstream MEK/ERK MAPK signaling via protein kinase A (PKA) and resulted in suppression of TNF production by transcriptional regulation."
		- [Histamine Derived from Probiotic _Lactobacillus reuteri_ Suppresses TNF via Modulation of PKA and ERK Signaling](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031951)
	- it seems a bit disingenuous to say histamine is antiinflammatory because it suppresses TNF. seems like trading one type of inflammation for another
