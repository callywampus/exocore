[A Review of the Mechanism of Injury and Treatment Approaches for Illness Resulting from Exposure to Water-Damaged Buildings, Mold, and Mycotoxins](https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/767482)
Exposure to mold and mold components are well known to trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions

Much of the toxicity from trichothecenes is felt to result from inhibition of protein synthesis.

endotoxins act synergistically with mycotoxins to enhance the cytokine-mediated inflammatory response

The development of new onset chemical sensitivity is also commonly seen after exposure and can have a severe impact on a person’s life [77].

It is important to note that studies have found that allergic response to mold is often not IgE mediated.

Allergic fungal rhinitis has long been identified as a cause of persistent nasal infection, receiving initial attention with a Mayo clinic study which found fungal growth in 96% of patients with chronic sinusitis [97]. Types of molds identified on culture in this study included _Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Cryptococcus,_ and many other types of mold known to produce mycotoxins or have the potential to cause significant disease.

Clinicians working with patients with neurocognitive symptoms resulting from exposure to water-damaged environments have seen improvement with the comprehensive treatment approaches outlined above including use of intranasal glutathione [2].

A study of 51 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who were treated with **intranasal amphotericin B** found improvement in nasal obstruction and discharge in 75% of the patients and 25% reported complete resolution of symptoms after treatment with improvement starting after one to three months. The only reported side effect was burning on application in 20% of the patients although no patients discontinued therapy due to side effects [100].

it is advised to use caution with oral antifungals given the risk of significant side effects, especially in those with cytochrome p450 polymorphisms affecting the metabolism of these drugs.

Although not completely successful, boron, and ammonium-chloride-based chemicals were the most successful in reducing mold and mycotoxin levels.

When dealing with mold issues, it may be best to avoid any fruit juice that isn’t fresh squeezed. Store bought juices, even organic, use citric acid derived from Aspergillus niger aka black mold. They are not required to disclose this on the label, but all store bought OJ and OJ concentrate have this citric acid added to balance pH. Aspergillus niger can be toxic because they rely on PUFAs to induce sporulation and they release oxylipins that are chemically similar to eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes

[Involvement of Sulfur in the Biosynthesis of Essential Metabolites in Pathogenic Fungi of Animals, Particularly Aspergillus spp.: Molecular and Therapeutic Implications)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02859/full)
Probably not too relevant to actual DIY treatment, but an interesting link between [[sulfur]] and fungi metabolism. Could be something to keep in mind if sulfur metabolism is bottlenecked, as lots of antimicrobial + detox supplements are sulfur-based.

Anon posited that sulfate-reducing bacteria(SRB) can break down gilotoxin. This may be a potential explanation for [[Sulfur Metabolism Theory of SIBO]]. Gilotoxin overload -> body facilitates SRB "overgrowth." I suppose it hinges on whether SRB have the ability to break the disulfide bridge that characterizes gilotoxin.
