# Saccharomyces boulardii
Saccharomyces boulardii is a type of yeast that is commonly used as a probiotic supplement. It is a non-pathogenic yeast strain that has been extensively studied for its beneficial effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Saccharomyces boulardii is known for its ability to support and restore the balance of the intestinal flora. It works by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. This helps to maintain a healthy microbial environment in the intestines.Research has shown that Saccharomyces boulardii can be effective in preventing and treating various gastrointestinal conditions, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and Clostridium difficile infection. It has also been studied for its potential benefits in inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and other digestive disorders.One of the unique characteristics of Saccharomyces boulardii is its resistance to antibiotics. Unlike many other probiotic strains, it is not affected by most antibiotics, allowing it to be taken concurrently with antibiotic therapy without being killed off.  Overall, Saccharomyces boulardii is considered a safe and well-tolerated probiotic supplement. It is available in various forms, including capsules, powders, and sachets, and can be found in many health food stores and pharmacies.

Saccharomyces Boulardii is a known binder for mold toxins <- verify?

Many of the supplements contain prebiotics which can have negative effects.

Saccharomyces boulardii if you suspect yeast, spore biotics if you suspect negative gram bacteria.

take it at the same time as a small amout of coconut oil to make sure it gets to the small intestine

saccharomyces is not representative of how all yeast behaves and yeast still certainly produces endotoxins (for example acetaldehyde)
