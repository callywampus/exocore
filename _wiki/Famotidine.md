# Famotidine
Famotadine is an H2 antagonist. Probably my personal favorite of the three because it's able to increase glycogen storage and suppresses gluconeogenesis. Famotadine is hepatoprotective and scavenges nitric oxide. There's not a lot of substances that directly suppress gluconeogenesis. Biotin, aspirin, and famotadine is about it. Famotadine of course is also anti-serotonin, perhaps powerfully so. Intravenous famotadine has been shown to stop serotonin syndrome. Downsides, it will lower stomach acid. If you're already severely hypothyroid, then your stomach acid is probably too low to benefit from famotadine. There is also some trouble with sourcing a clean product. Most of the pepcid pills on the market is full of excipients. You could gamble with chinese powders, and dissolve it in DMSO to take topically. Or dissolve pepcid in hot water and add a dash of ACV, because the acetic acid in the vinegar increases the solubility. Mix thoroughly, and wait for all the sediment to settle. That's the excipients that can be thrown out.

Two doses of 0.5mg per kg (~40mg for a ~190lb man) was enough to raise stomach pH from 1.3 to 6.6 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1887750/

20mg famotadine shown to increase stomach ph by 3.3 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s0054080020017

the H2 antagonism is useful in a pinch but may be offset by a reduction in stomach acid causing digestive problems
