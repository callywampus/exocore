# Lactate
Lactate and ammonia magnify mosquito attraction to CO2. Chemicals that ate stimulated by light emit fine infrared signals that are picked up by insect antennae like a tuning fork.

D-lactate is neurotoxic and hard to metabolize, so conceivably it can accumulate causing problems. L-lactate is easily metabolized.
