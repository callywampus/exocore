# Tetracycline
A quinone antibiotic

First-generation tetracyclines were obtained from chemical derivatives, doxycycline and minocycline, which have better bioavailability and increased tissue distribution, and a longer half-life for once-daily application.

Tetracyclines bind to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome .

A commonly accepted reason why tetracycline causes diarrhea is because it induces gut dysbiosis, specifically c diff. But this meta-analysis shows tetra use associated with a decreased risk of CDI
>In this metaanalysis, we found that the use of tetracyclines was associated with a 38% lower risk of CDI compared with use of other antibiotics.

It also cites in vitro effectiveness against c diff with resistance rates of 9.2%
