# Bile
## Intro
Bile is a green-yellow liquid, made out of bile salts (acids such as colic, chenodeoxycholic, lithocholic and deoxycholic), fatty acids, lecithin, inorganic salts and water all of which give it it’s alkalinity (bile has a PH of 7 to 8). It is produced in the hepatocytes (liver) in amounts of 600 all the way to even 1.200 ml per day (measured based on the amount that reaches the duodenum) and has **great antibacterial properties especially for the small intestine** (acts as bactericide) but protects us from enteric infections in general by excreting IgA (immune globulin A), is crucial for the absorption of fat soluble vitamins, byproducts of red blood cells called bilirubin, is an excretory route for lipophilic toxicants, and acts on the “surface” of lipids (triglycerides for examples) in order to emulsify them (partly why bile is responsible for the elimination of cholesterol) which is crucial step in order for pancreatic lipase to do its job properly.

## Anatomy
Bile is also stored in the gallbladder when it’s then transported to the duodenum with the help of hormones such as cholecystokinin, gastrin, somatostatin and secretin. These hormones signal to the gallbladder to release the stored bile and also promote gut motility.

Bile is generally not found in the upper gut (upper part of the duodenum, stomach, esophagus, larynx, and oral cavity) unless you are suffering from bile reflux. Bile salts are reabsorbed mainly by your body and stool when reaching the ileum, and as a result are not present in the large intestine either. By the time bile reaches the colon, 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed and sent back to the liver for recycling.

## Metabolism

The human bile salt pool is primarily comprised of cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and deoxycholic acids (DCA), with smaller amounts of lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The primary bile acids CA and CDCA are produced in the hepatocyte from cholesterol by the classic or alternative pathways involving multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. They are then conjugated with glycine or taurine (increasing their water solubility) prior to being excreted from the hepatocyte across the canalicular membrane via transporters also associated with Phase III detoxification: bile salt export protein (BSEP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein-2 (MRP2).
  
In the digestive tract, bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-active bacteria produce the enzyme BSH that deconjugates bile acids. _[[L. reuteri]]_ NCIMB 30242 is one such strain. Enzymes produced by these microbes deconjugate and dehydroxylate these bile acids, forming the secondary bile acids DCA (from CA) and LCA (from CDCA). Deconjugated bile acids are more hydrophobic and have greater detergent action, which increases their ability to facilitate solubilization and absorption of dietary lipids, fat soluble vitamins, and **break down bacterial membranes**. DCA is a particularly strong antimicrobial agent, having 10 times the antimicrobial activity of CA, its precursor. The secondary bile acids activate the pregnane X receptor(PXR).

[Vit C] is crucial for 7-alpha-hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol catabolism and bile acid synthesis.

"Normally, our intestine and liver destroy most of the [[Lipopolysaccharides]] endotoxin before it reaches the general circulation. The bile acids, a major end product of cholesterol, have a detergent action in the intestine that usually keeps endotoxin in solution, away from the absorptive surfaces of the intestine. If the flow of bile is obstructed, endotoxin is allowed to enter the system (Bertok, 2004). Estrogen can inhibit the flow of bile (Stieger, et aI., 2000). A mucus lining is part of the protective barrier, but the microscopic integrity of the intestinal cells themselves finally regulates the passage of materials into the blood and lymphatic vessels."  -RP

Bile acids have a multitude of effects throughout the body due to their interactions with the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR), In the hepatocyte, the majority of the actions of bile acids are mediated by FXR, which also plays a role in the synthesis, transport, and enterohepatic circulation of the bile acids themselves. Animal and in vitro studies suggest that activation of FXR by bile acids decreases plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and hepatic steatosis; reduces gluconeogenesis; and increases insulin sensitivity, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) transcription, and glycogen synthesis.

Although the condition of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), frequently seen in conjunction with obesity and T2D, is primarily attributed to increased triglyceride accumulation in the cells of the liver, it also is associated with dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation, and increased gut permeability. In addition to the antimicrobial, insulin-sensitizing, and triglyceride-reducing effects that bile acids have, **activation of FXR by bile acids also supports intestinal barrier integrity and reduces bacterial translocation**, positioning bile acids as a very promising agent for the treatment of this condition, which to date has no recommended pharmaceutical intervention.

## Bile and SIBO
The small intestine is also quite high in conjugated bile acids, or it should be—and these bile acids do in fact [decrease bacterial growth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1450168/#B9). (This does not apply to our “good” bacteria, though, as they are [resistant to the antimicrobial effects of bile](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.femsre.2004.09.003).)  
  
[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1450168/) also shows that when bile acid levels are lower (in cases of liver disease, for instance, or in animal models that have undergone surgical ligation, or closure, of the bile duct), [[SIBO]] tends to occur.  
  
Aside from their antimicrobial role, bile acids also [help to decrease small intestinal motility](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nmo.12148) (where the actual nutrient absorption happens), while [increasing large intestinal motility](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508512014564). The underlying cause of SIBO is very often low colonic gut motility, and bile plays a role here too.  
  
Bile also helps regulate and [may even initiate the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7714463), the process that sweeps the intestines clean in between meals. [Impairment in the MMC also predisposes to SIBO.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7557072)

Human commensals that live in the small intestine have adapted genes that promote bile resistance([21](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.femsre.2004.09.003/pdf), [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3872040/)). This gives them a competitive edge over pathogens that compete for nutrients. Since bile is antibacterial through its detergent-like effects, bacteria that aren’t bile resistant can’t colonize the small intestine. The ileum is an area ripe for overcolonization of bile-resistant commensals due to its proximity to the colon. In this area, bile resistance is overcome through the release of antimicrobial peptides by enterocytes. This happens when bile acids bind to FXR.

Bile acids are important — but you also need your bile to flow properly in order to deliver them to the small intestine via the bile duct. This is where phospholipids come in.  
  
Phospholipids, primarily [phosphatidylcholine](http://www.drlaurendeville.com/articles/phosphatidylcholine-weight-loss/) (since about 96% of the phospholipids in bile are this), help to emulsify bile, joining the water with the cholesterol [so that the latter doesn’t precipitate out of solution](http://www.drlaurendeville.com/articles/phosphatidylcholine-weight-loss/). (Too much cholesterol and too little phosphatidylcholine can lead to gallstones, or cholestasis: decreased bile flow.)  
  
In other words, if your phospholipids are low, you get [less bile delivered to your small intestines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9748591)—which is why low phosphatidylcholine levels can also lead to SIBO. Low phosphatidylcholine can occur due to low intake of its precursors (choline, high in eggs, liver, milk, and peanuts), or due to a backed up [[methylation]] pathway ([MTHFR](http://www.drlaurendeville.com/articles/mthfr-mutations/): according to [Dr Ben Lynch](https://www.amazon.com/Dirty-Genes-Breakthrough-Program-Optimize-ebook/dp/B072L4DSDC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527892873&sr=8-1&keywords=Dirty+Genes), some 70% of methylation gets used up in the production of phosphatidylcholine).

The [choline calculator from Chris Masterjohn](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/p/how-much-choline-should-i-eat-the) can be used to assess true choline requirements.

## Testing
Serum fasting levels of CDCA and FGF19 (a marker commonly used to assess for FXR activation)

## Supplementation
Ox bile is a mixture of various bile salts, plus bile pigment, as they appear naturally. ~~It is probably the safest way to supplement, as physiologically appropriate doses of complex substances gently stimulate the body rather than pushing a single pathway very strongly, leading to great potential for their systemic healing action.~~ **maybe**

UDCA (ursodeoxycholic acid) is isolated and concentrated, single bile salt. TUDCA (Tauroursodeoxycholic acid) is UDCA conjugated with Taurine. Forum bodybuilders use TUDCA as post cycle therapy but anedcotes are mixed.

TUDCA taken orally at a dose of **1,750 mg/day**, was shown to significantly improve hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity compared to placebo in obese individuals after four weeks of supplementation.

In one study of healthy females, short-term oral supplementation with CDCA at a dose of **15 mg/kg/day** was shown to be bioavailable and significantly increase BAT activity as well as whole body energy expenditure without any deleterious effects such as diarrhea.

Since bile is alkaline, it should be taken away from meals, since acidity is needed to digest meals.

### Side Effects
The use of ox bile is not without its drawbacks. Bile has great effects in the small intestine and colon but can cause problems in the stomach. Another issue is that you must first increase receptors that handle bile. Not doing this can can damage the gut. Ox bile supplementation may cause a bile backup in the liver, since it gets recycled. So supplementation should not exceed the liver's capacity to recycle

Itching may happen with potent synthetic derivatives of FXR agonists like OCA. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a synthetic variant of CDCA, produced by the addition of an ethyl group, which increases its binding affinity for FXR approximately 100-fold.
>In the context of bile acids, results of a double blind, placebo controlled, dose response phase II study on the use of obeticholic acid for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who had not responded completely to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid has been published in abstract form.85 Obeticholic acid is a synthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic acid, that is an agonist at the farsenoid nuclear receptor (FXR) and which has choleretic properties.86,87 FXR is a bile acid sensor associated with a decrease in bile acid production.88 The report documented that the administration of obeticholic acid was associated with a decrease in the activity of serum alkaline phosphatase. Pruritus, however, was a significant side effect in association with the two highest doses (25 and 50 mgs) of obeticholic acid tested, than in those who received placebo. The intensity of pruritus required discontinuation of the drug in some patients. Fifty percent of patients who received the placebo compound reported to experience pruritus, which was similar to the 48% that reported pruritus at the lowest dose (10 mg) of obeticholic acid. In the latter group, the pruritus was severe in some patients; severe pruritus was not reported in patients who received placebo. Many questions arise from the results of this study: did normal volunteers experienced pruritus in association with obeticholic acid?, what is the basis of obeticholic acid-associated pruritus vis-à-vis the pruritus of cholestasis? . If the pruritus of cholestasis was worsened by this new drug, the mechanism by which this effect is mediated merits investigation, as this finding may shed light on some aspect of the pathogenesis of this type of pruritus.
