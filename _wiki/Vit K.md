[What is the function of osteocalcin?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1349007920300542?via%3Dihub)
Osteocalcin is a protein that Vitamin K "activates" (carboxylates) for its concentration in bone. Recent findings have suggested that osteocalcin's presence in bone is required for optimal bone strength. It achieves this by aligning apatite crystals along collagen fibrils.

Vitamin K activates (carboxylates) a couple proteins to improve your bone health: osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein. Low K intake, low circulating vitamin K, low levels of osteocalcin activation, or low osteocalcin are all associated with more bone fractures. Low total osteocalcin in serum means it's concentrated in bone. It appears that osteocalcin actually rips calcium out of bones, but concentrates in bone once carboxylated, because that's where the calcium is.
