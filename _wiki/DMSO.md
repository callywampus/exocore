# DMSO

## Anti
**DMSO,** like many artificial compounds, is outright toxic for the human body. I personally tried some products with DMSO and each time my body temperature dropped and my physical wellbeing altered for the negative (aches/pain/etc.). It turns out that DMSO is _not_ harmless, as some manufacturers have led us to believe and even cherry-pick studies to support its use. DMSO has many negative side effects, and worst of all has a very long half-life, so it accumulates faster than the other parts of a product and takes a long time to clear out of the body. It can increase the potentially neurotoxic acetylcholine and stimulates histamine release. Even Ray Peat warns against using it. This one is a strong NO. - via [FPC](https://www.fuckportioncontrol.com/blog/2017/3/18/supplement-guide)
