# methylene blue
it seems that the effective dosage for relieving severe depression is around 50 milligrams per day. It is important to note that this dosage was found to be effective in a well-controlled study conducted 25 years ago. Additionally, the side effects of even higher doses were reported to be essentially zero.

It is also mentioned that in animal experiments, extremely high doses of methylene blue (equivalent to about four or five or six grams a day for a person) did not show any harmful effects.

"It works as a catalyst for energy production, and I think it can be very effective even in small doses analogous to the effects of thyroid hormone. I suspect that one milligram continues to have good effects for about a week."
