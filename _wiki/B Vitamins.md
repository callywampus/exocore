# B Vitamins
[DNA Methylation, Aging, And Cancer](https://raypeatforum.com/community/threads/dna-methylation-aging-and-cancer.2815/post-136950)
[[B1 Thiamine]], non-methylated [[B2 Riboflavin]], [[B3 Niacinamide]], [[B6]] (as P5P), biotin are safe to supplement. Non-methylated folate (not folic acid) and B5 (pantothenic acid) are still up for debate.

Folic acid and B12 should be avoided as they increase DNA [[Methylation]]

I suppose the logic behind taking non-methylated B vitamins is that their metabolism will require the use of a methyl group, thus inhibiting the likelyhood that methyl groups will be used to methylate DNA? Not sure how competitive or does it just increase the recycling of methyl donors.
