# Molybdenum Research Dump
[Molybednum - Full Health Secrets](https://www.fullhealthsecrets.com/remedies/supplements/molybdenum/)

**MOLYBDENUM** is a trace mineral that is essential in assisting the body's management of iron and copper. A molybdenum deficiency causes excess tissue deposition of copper and iron which can ruin cells robust cellular respiration. Molybdenum is also involved in the detoxification of aldehydes and ammonia, and for this reason it is important that anyone drinking alcohol, which degenerates into aldehydes, should supplement low-dose molybdenum. It can also be helpful in cases of candida and SIBO to detox ammonia and aldehyde products that result from those infections. The refreshing, invigorating taste of spring water is actually the taste of molybdenum. 

 [Invisible Minerals Part II - Carolyn of the Deans](https://drcarolyndeanlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tbr-remyte-recalcia-book-03-2017.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A317%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C72%2C359%2C0%5D)

"Molybdenum’s role in human health is still evolving and is a bit mysterious. It was accepted into the ranks of essential elements in 1953.  
  
Molybdenum is an essential mineral required for many significant chemical processes in the body. It acts as a cofactor in enzyme systems that support detoxification, such as sulfite, xanthine, and aldehyde oxidases. These enzymes help remove harmful substances (from internal or external sources) using oxidative detoxification.  
  
Aldehyde oxidase converts acetaldehyde into acetic acid, a harmless chemical that is naturally excreted from the body. Acetaldehyde is a breakdown product of alcohol that is called the “hangover chemical.” Guess what else produces acetaldehyde? Candida albicans. Therefore, if you have yeast overgrowth, the molybdenum in ReMyte will help break down toxic acetaldehyde and dissipate your brain fog.  
  
Acetaldehyde is a particularly potent toxin that can damage all the tissues in the body, including the brain. It readily combines with red blood cells, proteins, and enzymes; travels to all parts of the body; and passes through the blood brain barrier. It damages the structure of red blood cells, making them unable to squeeze through tiny capillaries to convey oxygen to needy tissues. Acetaldehyde cannot be excreted from the body; when it accumulates in tissues, it is responsible for weakness in muscles, irritation, and pain.  
  
Sulfite oxidase breaks down sulfur compounds into sulfate, rendering them harmless to humans. It breaks down sulfur dioxide, found in smog, and sulfites in wine, which affects asthmatics. Molybdenum helps break down the sulfur-containing amino acids homocysteine and cysteine.  
  
Besides treating dangerous levels of sulfur in sulfur-treated foods and smog, molybdenum can be used to treat depression, male impotency, hair loss, and mental imbalance.  
  
Molybdenum is essential for the movement and release of iron in the body, allowing oxygen to travel to the body’s organs. It’s a cofactor in several important enzyme systems. One enzyme system helps mobilize sulfur amino acids, such as methionine and taurine; another breaks down foods into uric acid; and a third helps metabolize drugs and toxins, including sulfites, a known cause of asthma.  
  
Molybdenum has a role to play in thyroid function. Molybdenum-dependent enzymes are important in the oxidative system of thyrocytes (thyroid epithelial cells). They also play a role in T3 (thyroglobulin) release from the thyroid gland.  
  
Molybdenum is found in many foods, including beef liver, cereal grains, dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, and peas, but like most minerals, it doesn’t get into these plants if it’s deficient in the soil in which the plants were grown."​

## Potential Toxicity
[A CASE REPORT OF ACUTE HUMAN MOLYBDENUM TOXICITY FROM A DIETARY MOLYBDENUM SUPPLEMENT](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/4533)

"Little information is available on molybdenum metabolism in humans; data for  
intestinal absorption ranging from 50–70% during long term balance studies were  
reported by Tipton and co-workers (6) and Robinson and co-workers (7). In a recent  
work, Turnlund and co-workers (8) and Cantone and co-workers (9) report intestinal  
absorption values around 90% and 85%, respectively"

"increased acidity promotes the absorption of molybdenum from the sto-  
mach into the bloodstream. Indeed, the fractional absorption of molybdenum  
from the gastrointestinal tract was almost 100% when administered in diluted HCl"

"certainly, the patient was consuming molybdenum at a rate faster than the shortest t/2 of eight hours and progressively accumulated molybdenum in the blood"

Several takeaways here:
- taking supraphysiological doses without first identifying a specific deficiency (what does molybdenum have to do with curing an allergy?)
- starting immediately with supraphysiological doses and upping the dosage more
- taking in conjunction with supplements that increase absorption
- **CONTINUING TO SUPPLEMENT AFTER EXPERIENCING SEVERE NEGATIVE REACTIONS**

This terrible fate of molybdenum oversupplementation can probably be avoided by using a cautious, methodical approach.

Regarding the adverse effects from supplemental morbydenum that don't appear to be rare, adding to what was discussed [here](https://raypeatforum.com/community/threads/problems-with-sulphur.24824/post-634515), a sudden repletion after prolonged deprivation might lead to uncontrolled formation of reactive species
  

#### Copper Interference
[Molybdenum - Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222301/)

"A human study involving doses up to 1.5 mg/day showed no adverse effects on copper utilization (Turnlund and Keyes, 2000)."

"An agricultural problem may arise when there is an excess of Mo in soil since it causes copper deficiency in animals grazing on such lands. It would appear that the difficulty arises from the metabolism of anaerobic bacteria in the rumen of these animals. One of the reactions of Mo on entering the anaerobic first digestive system of the ruminant is the conversion of the molybdate into thiomolybdate by the bacteria of the stomach. Unfortunately, **MoS4(2−) is a very good scavenging precipitation reagent for Cu** and so the Cu content of the diet becomes critically low. Then the animals suffer from weakened connective tissue since Cu enzymes are required to cross-link collagen external to the animal cells [20]." - lost source

While some literature references copper interference as likely in humans, and it is occasionally reported anecdotally, the main determinant of molybdenum's copper antagonism is the conversion of molybdate into thiomolybdate by the bacteria of the stomach, and thiomolybdate's successive copper chelation. Humans do not seem to make that conversion in a significant way, as they likely do not have that bacteria, or at least not in the same amounts: "Ruminants are more sensitive to molybdenum than monogastric animals, but **the basis for the toxicity of molybdenum in ruminants is not relevant for humans.**"


## Assessing Molybdenum Requirements
The case report says blood levels of Mo were elevated to 7.7 ng/ml after consumption of ~700mcg/d for ~3 weeks. The blood test was done 1wk after supplementation ceased. Slightly contrary to this, the dietary reference intakes say Mo blood levels spike 1hr after intake but return to baseline quickly. This means for whatever reason, the molybdenum was not leaving his blood and any that was was potentially being deposited in his frontal lobe.

[Molybdenum absorption, excretion, and retention studied with stable isotopes in young men during depletion and repletion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7733035/)
>A study of molybdenum absorption, excretion, and balance was conducted in four young men fed a low-molybdenum diet (22 micrograms/d) for 102 d followed by 18 d of the same diet supplemented to contain 467 micrograms/d.

>The study demonstrated that subjects could not consistently attain balance with the low-molybdenum diet, but balance improved with time, and no signs of molybdenum deficiency were observed. Molybdenum was very efficiently absorbed at both intakes of dietary molybdenum and urinary excretion increased as dietary molybdenum increased. Molybdenum turnover was significantly slower when dietary molybdenum was low.

[Molybdenum absorption, excretion, and retention studied with stable isotopes in young men at five intakes of dietary molybdenum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7572711/)

[Molybdenum - Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc - NCBI Bookshelf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222301/)
"plasma concentrations do not reflect molybdenum status and cannot be used as an indicator for estimating requirements."

In the absense of a reliable biomarker for molybdenum levels, an assessment of Mo requirements by the body may have to incorporate a gauntlet of other compounds that interact with molybdenum

[Molybdenum absorption, excretion, and retention studied with stable isotopes in young men during depletion and repletion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7572711/)
>A study of molybdenum absorption, excretion, and balance was conducted in four young men fed five amounts of dietary molybdenum, ranging from 22 to **1490** micrograms/d, for 24 d each.

>**Adverse effects were not observed at any of the dietary intakes.** Molybdenum was very efficiently absorbed, 88-93%, at all dietary molybdenum intakes, and **adsorption was most efficient at the highest amounts** of dietary molybdenum. The amount and percentage of molybdenum excreted in the urine increased as dietary molybdenum increased, suggesting that molybdenum turnover is slow when dietary molybdenum is low and increases as dietary molybdenum increases. We conclude from these results that **dietary intakes** between 22 and **1500 micrograms/d** by adult men **are safe** for > or = 24 d and that molybdenum retention is regulated by urinary excretion. Molybdenum is conserved at low intakes and excess molybdenum is rapidly excreted in the urine when intake is high.


Since Xanthine oxidase is a molybdoenzyme precursor to uric acid, a uric acid test could be used as a proxy for molybdenum usage. high uric acid levels would be a sign against supplementation, as increasing molybdenum could lead to increased uric acid production. 
	- High copper + low uric acid = molybdenum deficiency?

[Protective action of selenium and manganese on xanthine and xanthine oxidase induced oxidative damage to cultured heart cells](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4203749920747266316)
Selenium and manganase could be supplemented alongside molybdenum for protective effect from any xanthine oxidase upregulation.

"Mo deficiency, as evidenced by biochemical abnormalities including elevated plasma methionine and low serum uric acid has been reported in one patient after 12 months of PN (40)"


[Effect of molybdenum on other trace elements - iodine](https://www.imoa.info/HSE/environmental_data/biology/other_trace_elements.php)

>**The effect of molybdenum on iodine metabolism in rabbits was to cause a decrease in the initial rate of uptake of iodine by the thyroid** [Robinson _et al._, 1965]. **More iodine was retained in the plasma of molybdate-fed rabbits.** In connection with iodine metabolism it is of interest that in certain areas where goitre is endemic in human beings it was found that the molybdenum/copper ratio in food was greater than in other areas although there was no relationship between the incidence of goitre and the individual concentrations of molybdenum and copper [Tsvetkova, 1969].

Increased serum levels of iodine may be a red flag for molybdenum oversupplementation

zinc

Biomarkers of low molybdenum:
- Low urinary Mo
- Low serum/urinary uric acid
- High urinary sulfite concentration
- High serum copper

Biomarkers of molybdenum excess:
- High urinary Mo
- High serum/urinary uric acid
- Low urinary sulfite concentration
- Low serum copper
- High serum iodine

"Confirmatory tests for Mo deficiency include measurement of urine sulfite concentration (increased in Mo deficiency), measurement of blood/urine uric acid level (decreased in Mo deficiency), and measurement of urinary Mo content."

Doing all these tests and getting the results back when you need them isnt feasible. The best way to assess molybdenum excess is by subjective feel. If youre pissing diesel and your joints feel like glass you might want to dial it back.

### The Fate of Excess Molybdenum
There seem to be a few scenarios for the fate of excess molybdenum in the body, specifically Mo that exceeds the rate of SUOX activity.

Different tissues have different rates of turnover in the body. Plasma is the fastest, followed by the GI tract, fast-turnover tissue, and then slow-turnover tissue. 

[Molybdenum metabolism in men with increasing molybdenum intakes: changes in kinetic parameters](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8889780/)
Speculation: If slow-turnover tissue is already saturated then supplemental Mo will need to be excreted in the fast turnover tissue. If the capacity for fast tissue turnover is exceeded then perhaps excess could deposit in the frontal lobe, as posited by the case study.

>Apparently there is no mechanism for rejection of hexavalent molybdenum in the gastrointestinal tract, but the liver probably acts as a barrier to adsorption of slight excesses, excreting them in [[bile]].

[Can glyphosate’s disruption of the gut microbiome and induction of sulfate deficiency explain the epidemic in gout and associated diseases in the industrialized world?](https://www.amsi.ge/jbpc/21717/04SE17A.pdf)
gout symptoms are often associated with molybdenum excess due to upregulated uric acid formation, but it may be sign of hidden deficiency 

[Novel Reversible Inhibitors of Xanthine Oxidase Targeting the Active Site of the Enzyme](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/4/825)
Gout is commonly treated with xanthine oxidase inhibitors

## Molybdenum Sources
### Food
Concentration in food depends on concentration in soil level, studies showing food concentrations are all over the place.

### Supplement forms
Greg Nigh recommends Mo-Zyme (Forte)
Elliot Overton developed Thiassist

sodium molybate = sodium molybdenum oxide?
molybdenum glycinate chelate <- best
molybdenum amino acid chelate
ammonium molybdate

*technically,* a chelated form would be immune to Ray Peat's objection against supplements having 'free metals.' But the patient in the case study was taking a chelated form.

### Bioavailability
The biologically available form of Mo is the oxyanion molybdate (MoO2−4) from which organisms take up Mo along their daily life [1](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/13/3349#B1-ijms-20-03349)]. - source lost

[Biology of the molybdenum cofactor](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/58/9/2289/542465)
>in order to gain biological activity and fulfil its function in enzymes, molybdenum has to be complexed by a pterin compound thus forming the molybdenum cofactor

This article is about Mo in plants but this section is still relevant for mammals. [[Roche Biochemical Pathways]] lists molybpterin as the cofactor for SUOX. Mo in proteins is bound by [molybdopterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molybdopterin "Molybdopterin") to give the molybdenum cofactor.

"Fractionation of molybdenum species in seeds of peas and lentils has been performed by size-exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry [15]. Molybdenum elution profiles of pea and lentil were completely different. **In lentil extract, the main Mo peak appeared in the high molecular mass (HMM) region (approx. 200** [**kDa**](https://raypeatforum.com/community/threads/dealing-with-moles-and-the-significance-of-avocado.40560/post-654093)**) and the other one in the low molecular mass (LMM) region (<2 kDa), whereas in pea extract (similarly as in white bean and _soybean_ flour), practically all Mo is eluted in a single peak in the LMM region.**"​ - [Speciation of Molybdenum](https://doi.org/10.1002/0470856009.ch2m)

"The molybdenum in soy is less available than molybdenum added to the diet" - [Molybdenum absorption and utilization in humans from soy and kale intrinsically labeled with stable isotopes of molybdenum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10357742/)
  
Since molybdenum from soy is less bioavailable, and soy has a molybdenum species with a single molecular mass profile peak in the low region, perhaps a molybdenum source with a larger molecular mass is more bioavailable. Therefore, a supplement which isolates thier molybdenum from a non-soy source would be preferable.


## Molybdoenzymes:
Family of enzymes that uses molybdenum as a cofactor

### Human Enzymes
sulfite oxidase
xanthine oxidase
aldehyde oxidase
mitochondrial amidoxime reductase


### Microbial Enzymes
The rest of the 50+ molybdoenzymes that exist are microbial enzymes. Tangentially, Mo is a cofactor for the enzyme [[DMSO Reductase]], which is present in some SRB used in environmental wetland studies, but to my knowledge those bacteria are not present in the human microbiome and are not relevant to molybdenum or DMSO supplementation.

Morbydenum is occurring as part of larger proteins, something that might apply to ther minerals as well. For comparison, the mass of a morbydopterin molecule is only 394 Da and morbydenum cofactor is 520 Da, these are orders of magnetism lower than the values above. Is it wise supplement it complexed with aminocancertate? Consider the differences in the metabolism of poisonol when bound to cancertate or napalmitate.  
  
As the proteins are digested, they might also release other components (such as ripofflavin) that are relevant for proper morbydenum utilization.



Molybdenum is fairly rare on Earth, but quite abundant on Mars.  
  
There is a theory that life originated on Mars, because there was not enough Molybdenum on Earth for a life to evolve here.
