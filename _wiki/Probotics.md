# Probotics
>(clausi, coagulens, subtilis) are really good because they are L-lactate producers. I haven't formed an opinion yet on S. boulardii, but Pediococcus acidilactici, which I've never heard of, would give me reason for concern. Under anaerobic conditions it converts L-lactate to D-lactate, which in my mind is worse than a probiotic that produces D-lactate. D-lactate is neurotoxic and hard to metabolize, so conceivably it can accumulate causing problems. L-lactate is easily metabolized.
