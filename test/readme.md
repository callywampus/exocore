To use this code to create a canvas that shows the relationship between the pages at amenbreak.netlify.app, you need to modify the following parts:

The graph data structure: You need to populate the graph with the pages and their links as nodes and edges. You can either hard-code them, or use a web scraper or an API to fetch them dynamically. For example, you can use axios to make HTTP requests and cheerio to parse HTML.
The graph layout algorithm: You need to choose a suitable layout algorithm that can arrange the nodes and edges in a way that reflects their relationships. For example, you can use force-directed layout, which simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to create a natural-looking graph. You can use graphology-layout-forceatlas2 as a library for this purpose.
The graphics objects for nodes and edges: You need to customize the appearance and behavior of the graphics objects for each node and edge. For example, you can use different colors, shapes, sizes, labels, icons, etc. to represent different types of pages or links. You can also add interactivity such as zooming, panning, dragging, highlighting, etc. to enhance the user experience.

Libraries and dependencies are external code packages that provide functionality or features that you can use in your own code. For example, PixiJS is a library that provides graphics rendering, Graphology is a library that provides graph data structures and algorithms, axios is a library that provides HTTP requests, and cheerio is a library that provides HTML parsing.

To install libraries and dependencies with npm or yarn, you need to use the command line and run specific commands that tell the package manager what packages to install and how to install them. For example:

To install a package as a project dependency, which means it is required for your code to run, you can use the following commands:

npm install --save package_name
yarn add package_name
To install a package as a development dependency, which means it is only required for your code development, such as testing or linting, you can use the following commands:

npm install --save-dev package_name
yarn add package_name --dev
To install multiple packages at once, you can list them separated by spaces after the command:

npm install --save package_name1 package_name2 package_name3
yarn add package_name1 package_name2 package_name3
When you install packages with npm or yarn, they will be downloaded and stored in a folder called node_modules in your project directory. They will also be added to a file called package.json, which keeps track of your projectâ€™s metadata and dependencies. Additionally, yarn will create or update a file called yarn.lock, which records the exact versions of the packages installed.
