# Endotoxemia
Bacterial overgrowth like [[SIBO]] will eventually cause endotoxemia. Turnover of gram-negative bacteria will cause [[Lipopolysaccharides]] to trigger the [[TLR-4]] receptor and initiate an inflammatory process involving cytokine + [[nitric oxide]] pathway. Once LPS is ferried to the bloodstream by saturated fat, HDL and LDL will bind to LPS<sup>1, 2</sup> and carry it to the liver to be detoxed. When LPS load is high, this puts stress on the liver that can lead to NAFLD and insulin resistance. 

## Blood tests for endotoxemia markers:
- Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP)
- HDL
	- low HDL could indicate high LPS load
- Soluble CD14
	- [sCD14 is a protein that is released from the membrane of some immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, when they encounter bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258%2819%2965558-4/pdf)
	- [sCD14 can bind to LPS in the presence of another protein called lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and transfer it to a receptor complex on the cell surface, composed of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MD-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD14)
	- [A high level of sCD14 may indicate a high risk of developing severe sepsis or organ failure, especially in patients with Gram-negative bacterial infections](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/12/4/781)
- Liver enzymes
	- Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
	- Alanine transaminase (ALT)
	- Aspartate transaminase (AST)

These enzymes are normally present in the liver cells and help the liver perform its functions of producing protein, clearing bilirubin, and metabolizing drugs and toxins. [However, when the liver is exposed to high levels of LPS, which are components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that can trigger inflammation and sepsis, these enzymes can be released into the bloodstream and indicate liver damage or disease](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09680519020080050501) [LPS can activate the liver cells and cause them to produce inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which can further damage the liver tissue and increase the permeability of the blood vessels](https://journal-inflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12950-018-0197-4) [LPS can also impair the function of the Kupffer cells, which are the resident macrophages of the liver that are responsible for clearing LPS and other toxins from the blood](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11605-021-05188-7) [When the Kupffer cells are overwhelmed or dysfunctional, LPS can accumulate in the liver and cause oxidative stress, apoptosis, and necrosis of the liver cells](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11605-021-05188-7) These processes can result in the leakage of liver enzymes into the circulation, which can be detected by blood tests.

LBP and soluble CD14 tests don't seem to be available to non-practicioners. Only ones are ELISA kits that I assume are sold to pros running their own labs for a study.

In the meantime walk-in-lab has a Hepatic Function Panel blood test for ~$30 that includes HDL and liver enzymes, this could in theory be used as a proxy for LPS load.

## Solutions
Tyical Peat stuff can mitigate endotoxemia, arguably the functional crux of the entire Peat framework is reversing the chronic autoimmune symptoms driven by endotoxemia. However, adding [[Thyroid]] (T3) may not help in this instance.
>"When your cholesterol is so low, your body can't respond fully to a thyroid supplement. Thyroid should cause the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and the other neurosteroids, but when cholesterol is too low it just increases stress hormones instead."<sup>3</sup>

Progesterone supplementation can fill the gap by skipping the conversion from cholesterol to pregnenelone to progesterone, allowing P4 to convert directly into the downstream neurosteroids. **Progesterone at a dose of 1mg/kg is also widely protective against endotoxin symptoms, *and may even bind directly to LPS in vitro.***<sup>4</sup>

TLR4 signaling antagonists could also mitigate inflammatory response.
