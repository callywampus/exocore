#  2023-12: Draft 2
**Update: ON 12/15/23** I took 50mcg molybdenum w/ 650mg beatine HCL downed with a glass of milk: 

Warm flush, brain fog disappeared INSTANTLY - to me this indicates a sulfur metabolism bottleneck. Sulfite is a culprit, as molybdenum is a cofactor in the sulfite oxidase enzyme (SUOX) that oxidizes sulfite into sulfate.

Some less pleasant symptoms included slight jaw clenching, and “shaky” feeling - overexcitation from metabolic bottleneck release? They dissipated quickly but it is definitely something I do not want to instigate. 

**On 12/16/23** I ate chicken parm with rice and squash. Soon after finishing the meal, I began experiencing all-too-familiar throat tightness. I usually attributed this to an unknown allergy or some generalized histamine episode like Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, but this time I suspected it was a sulfite overload, which would mimic an allergy due to sulfite-induced mast cell degranulation. 

25mcg molybdenum cleared symptoms within 15min.

"H2S is known to covalently modify ferryl/peroxo heme within hemoglobin and myoglobin resulting in the formation of green colored sulfhemoglobin and sulfmyoglobin species, both of which are indicators of H2S poisoning ([89](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/#R89))." - [Pathways involved in enzymatic biogenesis of H2S](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/figure/F3/). My stools have been green for many months, indicating H2S load.

H2S would also explain why I did not test positive on lactulose breath test 

## Action Items: (In order of priority)
- Molybdenum 
	- SUOX cofactor
	- toxicity concerns re: [A CASE REPORT OF ACUTE HUMAN MOLYBDENUM TOXICITY FROM A DIETARY MOLYBDENUM SUPPLEMENT](https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/4533)
	- uric acid as proxy
- Trace Minerals 
	- Molybdenum is essential for the movement and release of ==iron== in the body
	- thiomolybdate MoS4(2−) is a very good scavenging precipitation reagent for ==copper==
	- - ==Selenium== and ==manganase== protect against damage from molybdenum-cofactor enzyme overexpression - [Protective action of selenium and manganese on xanthine and xanthine oxidase induced oxidative damage to cultured heart cells](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4203749920747266316)
	- H2S is known to covalently modify ferryl/peroxo heme within hemoglobin and myoglobin resulting in the formation of green colored sulfhemoglobin and sulfmyoglobin species, both of which are indicators of H2S poisoning ([89](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/#R89)). Additionally, H2S can react with nonheme iron present in iron-sulfur cluster containing proteins to generate insoluble precipitates ([65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/#R65)). Lastly, H2S is reported to react with a copper-containing protein (Cu—Zn—SOD) ([90](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/#R90)). - [Pathways involved in enzymatic biogenesis of H2S](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/figure/F3/).
	- H2S can react with metallic centers (iron, copper, zinc, molybdenum) producing coordination complexes and, in some circumstances, donating electrons. - [Hydrogen Sulfide and Persulfides Oxidation by Biologically Relevant Oxidizing Species](https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox8020048)
		- it appears H2S puts strain on many trace minerals, while low Cu could be indicative of high molybdenum, ==low trace minerals in general could be indicative of high H2S load on tissues,== which I suspect is the case with me.
	
- B vitamins Panel
	- B1 B2 B3 B6 involved in many enzymes, my diet has been low dietary sulfur and thus low protein and thus low b vitamins
- Fat Soluble Vitamins
	- A,E,D,K involved in many enzymes
- Hormone Panel
	- Sulfation necessary for phase 2 liver detoxification which processes estrogen, sulfur metabolism bottleneck may result in estrogen dominance
- Metabolic Panel
	- When present at higher concentrations it causes reversible inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), thereby perturbing mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation ([46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/#R46)). This is further exemplified by the observations that H2S induces a state of “suspended animation” with consequent lowering of metabolic rate and body temperature in mice ([61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/#R61))." - [Pathways involved in enzymatic biogenesis of H2S](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029659/figure/F3/).
		- Most of the studies demonstrating inhibitory effect of H2S on respiration via interaction with CcO were done using very high/nonphysiological concentrations of H2S.
