# Stress + EMF = Allergy
Symptoms: sudden onset of severe anaphylactic reactions to seemingly unconnected foods

suspect root cause: chronically elevated cortisol + EMF exposure due to work

Reasoning:

emf stimulates calcium channels and nitric oxide-peroxynitrite-oxidative stress pathway https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.12088 

Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammation. It gives an anti-inflammatory effect under normal physiological conditions. On the other hand, **NO is considered as a pro-inflammatory mediator that induces inflammation due to over production in abnormal situations.** https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10787-007-0013-x#:~:text=Nitric%20oxide%20(NO)%20is%20a,over%20production%20in%20abnormal%20situations. 

The activation of mast cells (MC) is part of the innate and adaptive immune responses and depends on Ca2+Â entry across the plasma membrane **(aka calcium channels)**, leading to the release of preformed inflammatory mediators by degranulation https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171366

**stress increases histamine mast cell content** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2343625/#:~:text=Note%20that%20stress%20increases%20histamine%20mast%20cell%20content

So that's a direct link between cortisol and mast cell histamine production (via HPA axis?), a direct link between emf and mast cell histamine production via calcium channels, haven't found a pathway for nitric oxide and mast cell histamine production but it's generally accepted oxidative stress will increase negative effects of NO regarding inflammation markers, and inflammation markers signal histamine production. The nitric oxide-peroxynitrite-oxidative stress pathway is a suspect here.

Self-diagnosis: chronic overproduction of histamine by mast cells due to chronically elevated cortisol and EMF exposure, triggering oxidative stress cascade, causing endothelial dysfunction and severe anaphylactic reactions to foods

Potential solution: cypro

Cyproheptadine blocks calcium channels https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6538269/#:~:text=We%20conclude%20that%20the%20primary,headache%20and%20other%20neurologic%20disorders.

cypro is an antihistamine as well, H1 antagonist

I am already taking an famotidine (H2 antagonist + scavenges nitric oxide), so an H1/Calcium channel blocker could help complete the defense and initiate the "pattern break" to break out of the stress cascade

Hesitant to rely on pharma corticosteroid interventions like prednisone that depend on adrenal systems, cortisol, and nitric oxide because they *may* cover acute symptoms but worsen chronic condition
