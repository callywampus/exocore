Bad News and Good News

A message for Dr

Hello, I have some bad news and good news. Luckily, I believe the good outweighs the bad. I will start with the bad:

- On Saturday Dec 9, I had a reaction to a meal. The meal was a reuben sandwich. The reaction included symptoms of stress response, flushing of the face, and hives. I did not have my epi pen so went to the ER but symptoms had subsided by then and initial bloodwork looked normal.

- Also worth noting that on Dec 6 I had an immediate stress response to a meal mainly comprised of ground beef.

- I have also responded poorly to supplements allicin, vit B1, and flowers of sulfur

A pattern I have noticed is that beef is high in the amino acids methionine and cystine, and cabbage (from the sauerkraut on the reuben) is a brassica vegetable, meaning both of these meals are high in dietary sulfur. Allicin is a garlic extract, B1 is an organosulfur compound, and flowers of sulfur is obviously a sulfur derivative. Hence, I have noticed a pattern of sulfur intolerance. My good news is that I believe noticing this pattern of sulfur intolerance has led to a potential breakthrough in assessing the root cause of my SIBO. 

If there are issues with my sulfur metabolism, it is possible that my body my will wind up with a buildup of inorganic sulfate and/or sulfite. A buildup of either of these is undesirable, as sulfate must be activated into phosphosulfate before it can be used for the sulfation process,<sup>1</sup> which is essential for survival, and sulfite is well known to be quite cytotoxic.<sup>2</sup> It is meant to be an intermediary, NOT meant to be accumulated. So a buildup of sulfate and/or sulfite is very dangerous!

So, how does the body respond when primary sulfur metabolism is compromised?

Enter Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria(SRB). These bacteria can metabolize sulfate and sulfite to create hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide produced in the gut may be directly absorbed into circulation and diffuse through tissues, where it is oxidized into the necessary sulfate. In fact, the primary pathway for H2S clearance is via intracellular sulfide oxidation.<sup>3</sup>

I am seriously entertaining the idea that a bottleneck in my sulfur metabolism has caused my body to "allow" an overgrowth of SRB as a sort of "backup" sulfur metabolism. This theory is the best explanation I have that addresses a root cause for my intolerance to certain supplements, my reactions to certain foods, and the SIBO that reoccurs despite multiple rounds of treatment. There are many details to flesh out, and I have some actionable ideas about how to test this, but I wanted to run a basic overview by you and get your thoughts on the matter. I would value them greatly.
